0,I had an accident with an Uber driver in Mexico City. The car that I got into had no side mirror. The Brakes were not working properly either. I almost got into an accident twice. The driver's conversation was unpleasant. Being a foreigner he was very curious to ask where I am from and what brought me to Mexico. I replied to be a tourist and through that conversation is over. He became very rude and asked me if I came to look for a Mexican husband. I never answered and kept quiet. He took the wrong route and made several in requested stops. Having in mind it was uberX. He continued asked me whom I sleep with. He literally stopped the car and asked me to wait for him text someone. I asked him to let me go and take a different driver but he locked the doors and didn't allow me.,
1,I have had my account completely hacked to where I cannot sign in or view it. Someone spent over $1k in Uber rides on my credit and debit cards linked to the account and when I dialed the only number available (safety line) I was told I would need to wait until another department emailed me. I didn't hear anything for almost 24 hours and when I did it was a prompted message that did not help at all. It has been almost 2 days and I still have no received a phone call or any helpful support via email. This is a nightmare and the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. I am going to be filing a police report to the person who myself and the driver caught fraudulently using my account and looking into an attorney for Uber not making identity theft a priority and rectifying the situation on their end.,
1,I requested an 8 mile ride in Boston on a Saturday night around 1:00 am that was coming up around $55 on the app and Lyft was around the same rate. Ended up taking a regular cab that cost me $20. Beware of high rates.,
1,Uber is overcharging for Toll fees. When In Florida the Tolls fees estimates between $ .75 to $ 2.00. Uber price shown will be Example $ 16.73 for the ride. After you take the ride you get charge 28.23 and when you check the account it's telling you that you got charge for Tolls. The driver never took the toll route and you try to contact Uber company and they take long to get back to you about the issue of being overcharge. I try to email them and let them know about the extra charges and why am I being charge for a service that I didn't receive.,
1,"I had an airport flight today. Uber would not accept my credit card, my Venmo, or my PayPal. As a last resort I brought an Uber gift card to cover my ride to the airport. I'll be damned the Uber App wouldn't even accept their own gift card. My daughter downloaded three of her cards to her app to buy me a ride and sure enough they wouldn't accept her cards either. As a last resort she brought me a ride from Lift with no problem. I'm sending Uber back their gift card certified mail and demanding a refund. After much stress I barely made my flight. I'm also deleting Uber's App and will never, ever use them again. Laura",
1,"In July of this year I had sushi delivered to me in Mexico by UberEats, a subsidiary of Uber, on five occasions. The total cost was 1,918 pesos -- about $100 US. However, I was billed $1,919 dollars(!) on my credit card; something I discovered at the end of the month when paying my credit cards. I contacted Uber Customer Support (Uber does not provide any number to call, so all customer service work has to be through the via email messaging) and I was told that, due this was a glitch in the app and my charges would be refunded.",
1,"My driver, Rohan was nice, but when I tried to add tip I noticed that he had switched my $9 9am fare in French Quarter to someone else's 2pm trip in Metairie for $28.00! UBER refused to acknowledge. 5 attempts to rectify problem and received nothing but irrelevant automated replies. If you get in the car with Rohan in NOLA and he says he can't get his system to work, it's a a SCAM. Terrible customer service from UBER with zero relevant assistance after 7 days of requesting corrected bill. BEWARE.",
1,"I had seven fraudulent Uber transactions over three days in mid-October on my credit card. For nearly a week, I tried unsuccessfully to get Uber customer service to help. Uber was totally uncooperative. They refused to engage in the fraudulent charges someone in their system imposed on me. I had to cancel my credit card, get a new credit card and leave my credit card company to battle awful Uber. Uber buyer beware. I know I will never use their services again.",
0,"Our driver never showed up and Uber cancelled our ride, not us. They charged us a cancellation fee for them cancelling. When I disputed it they would only credit it on future ride instead of refund back to our credit card. Why am I only getting a credit on account instead of a full refund to my credit card used?? This is not right what you have done when it was a Uber error.",
1,"When the service worked, it was good, and tech support responds quickly most of the time. Unfortunately, that doesn't make up for the problems I encountered. The app rejected my credit card and offered no explanation as to why. For some reason it accepted my PayPal even though it uses the very card the app had just rejected. It took days of back and forth with tech support to find out that my card ""isn't compatible with their system"", but they refused to be more specific than that and no matter how many times I asked what the exact problem was (ie my bank, the type of card, etc) all they did was rephrase the same answer over and over again with canned responses; repeatedly telling me to check w/ my bank, even after I told them I already had done so.",
1,"They didn't have cars available at Bush International Airport on October 15, 2018 at 9:30 pm. Had to take a taxi. This is the second time I have experienced this, and will be my last as I will use Lyft or a taxi in the future.",
0,"Don't use it, that's my recommendation!. I ordered uber, selected the car to come and pick me up , got the confirmation that Musa (driver) is coming in 14 min (price selected was 11-14EUR). Guess what 15 min later got another message that another driver is coming in 25 min.. He came after 27 min and charged me 17.5EUR +3.50EUR extra for the time....? So, he came late and i'm charged extra for this time.... I need to mention as well that i was going to hospital to change my cast, as i have a broken leg and i'm in crutches; moreover was poring rain outside.... When i got teh invoice after i'ev been charges, i sent an email, over and over again , nobody have any reply. I called them few times, and left voice messages (as nobody ever picks up the phone), no call bank nor reply until now, over 3 weeks has passed already. Don't use it, you have nobody to complain to in case the driver is rude or even offensive, and they just charge you whatever they wish, always EXTRA, never less",
0,Upfront pricing not true pricing. Uber pads the bill so much. I've had Uber drivers charge for wait time when they are parked down from my house and I am out on my front porch waiting and watching them. Booking fee $3.05 come on! Toll and surcharges plus time and distance charges. Now they are dropping me off a few blocks from my destination saying they got to take another call. Uber drivers that I have used have showed up at my house wanting a hookup. One driver started groping me on my front porch. Uber customer service is a brick wall. Credited me $3.00 on a ride on Uber Cash. No matter what they do or charge they have an excuse and they are right. When I reported the sexual harassment of the two drivers they suspended my account. They cost more than a taxi and a taxi never has told me to get out and walk the rest of the way.,
0,"Drive with Uber you need to get better. I currently drive for Uber but am concerned with some drivers taking advantage of people with disabilities. I had picked up a Uber customer who had a 3 star rating, which to me I thought there was something wrong but still decided to accept the ride. When I picked up the gentleman I realized he was blind. As he got in my car we had a conversation and he told me that I was the quickest pick up he has ever gotten and asked me why. He told me he usually has to keep requesting Ubers over and over. I know why. It's because the drivers are declining a 3 star rider. I told him it was because I don't pass up any opportunities to pick people up to get them to their destination. He was the most kindest man I have ever met and I realized that other drivers have given him low ratings just because he had a disability.",
0,"Uber quoted me a fare of £14. Their driver turned up late, took a very long route, got lost and then charged me nearly £35. I complained and they reduced it to £26. They will not refund the money to the £14 they quoted me.This is theft.DO NOT USE UBER THEY ARE THIEVES AND DISHONEST.",
0,"Driver was fine and so was ride. Experience of dealing with getting a coupon for first ride had me looking for a human being to talk to, and was amazed to find there was no one. I think they charge enough to hire customer service of some kind. I couldn't even find a human online.",
0,I called uber for going home two days ago and yesterday they charged me extra 40$ even no one told me reason. Then I contacted uber and they told me driver complained me about I was drunk or something else they sent me stupid pictures. I didn't understand exactly what happened but I just called uber and went home even I didn't talk to driver and went home. How come no one asked me anything and they just charged me 40$ directly. I will take my money back and I will delete uber.,
1,"This is the email I tried to send back to uber after getting a welcome email saying how easy it was to get help (complete fabrication): the email was waiting after I got home a few days after the uber-disasterHi,Well, my attempted first trip was an absolute disaster!!1. The app did not get my current address right, and didn't want me to alter the house number. Even so, I actually wanted it to leave from a few doors down. When I finally got it to accept the new house number, it would not let me enter the suburb.2. After entering the destination, it said it would not give me a quote until AFTER I had entered credit card details. I thought this would be OK, since I'd seen estimated costs at a bit over $1 per km. But it wanted to charge me well over $900!!!!! (the trip should have been about $60, from similar trips by others). There was no obvious way to cancel, just confirm, so I closed the app thinking it would cancel .3. I re-entered the app to try the trip again. But even though I had NOT confirmed the previous attempt, it said I could not enter a trip as one was already booked for the same time.4, There was no obvious way to cancel the trip, not any way to ring or email uber to get it fixed.5. Did some searching, seems there is no way to handle emergency fixes. Utter shame on you. Many others have had similar experiences in being unable to contact anyone when something went wrong.6. Finally found a site explaining how to cancel future trips, hidden in a side menu, which I did, fortunately before the exorbitant charge was taken from my bank.Until I get over this really bad experience with your obvious complete disdain for users, and your really, really terrible app design, I will tell everybody I meet to stay away from uber, the uber-bad transport option. And intend never to use it again myself, unless something changes.",
0,"Cherry picker???? Asks you where exactly you are going after he picks the order, asks if the lady is going alone, calculates if it is good money and company, then cancels the trip if it is not. You cant review him since the trip hasn't started, so he has pretty nice rate level. Happened to me, not sure how many people he has innocently questioned like that and cancelled the order.",
1,Uber in the Southwestern corner of AZ has increased the prices by 11% and are keeping anywhere from 40 to 60% of the fare. Charging for a longer distance but send the driver the shortest. Lyft has con up by 6% and is still cheaper than uber.,
1,"I ordered myself for a ride about 10 blocks away from my home to a restaurant knowing I would be consuming alcohol. They offered me a discounted ride to walk to the corner of my block for pickup. I agreed to that. Once I confirmed my ride, I was notified I would be dropped off about 4 blocks away from the restaurant. I never agreed to that. That part was not advertised. That area is unsafe being is next to a highway ramp with no crosswalks or traffic signals to get to my destination. So I immediately canceled the ride.",
0,"Uber drivers in Honolulu, Hawaii are charging passengers extra and they have to pay them via Apple Pay or cash. Tried contacting Uber to talk about this issue. Asked for a supervisor and they gave me the runaround. I want to let people know what Uber drivers are doing. Don't know if it is just in Hawaii or other places. I had to choose one star but if it was up to me it would be -5.",
0,Uber is a horrible  company  to work for.uber treats there drivers like pure trash.the customers  are always right nomatter what the uber driver says .uber is nothing but a pack of greedy wolves  who care about nothing or no one but themselves .uber has proven there fakeness .uber is a 0 0 in my opinions,
1,A transportation app that has come to improve on thé day to day runing of activities all over accra or Ghana,
0,I used to really like Uber and over the years only had 1 bad driver but this year I'm constantly having billing problems and having multiple extra charges above fare and tip to the point of overdrawing my bank account. Reaching customer service is a totally separate hell to go thru. I have to find an alternative because I see NO EFFORT on uber to resolve any of this.,
1,"Uber one minute gave me a quote of $50 on a ride I needed. A kind family member helped me to pay for it by purchasing an Uber gift card for me. As soon as I loaded the gift card onto my account, I brought the same ride up in app--and now, not 10 minutes later, it showed $63! Just to see if this was due to surge pricing, I tried the same ride in Lyft. It was $50--the same price Uber had quoted me before I loaded the Uber gift card.",
1,Worst customer service. In Uber initial fare shown only rs. 45 after ride completes it shown as rs. 90 double the charge. So I trying to customer service but all numbers not reachable. Very worst service.,
1,"I completed a trip and didn't get a receipt. There's no support number and when I went to online help, it didn't understand my question, no matter how I worded it. So I guess I'm just screwed. Thanks, Uber!",
1,I have advised many people NOT to use it to save their time and money. They charged me for a service they have not offered twice and I lost about £10.00 (about £5.00 each time).I ordered a taxi and the taxi driver did not come and they still charged me. They did that again shortly afterwards.Never download this damned Uber App!! Their Refund Claim is a joke. It was very time consuming e-mailing them back and forth with a ZERO- result. They literally STOLE my money. What a shame that all this comes from a taxi company that lies about their customer service. Please listen to this golden piece of advice: NEVER use this taxi company!,
1,"I was recently charged for an Uber Pass, which I did not want.  I use Uber a few times a month and it wouldn't pay to get the Pass.  When I saw the charge on my PayPal, I attempted to contact Uber, however they make it impossible to contact them.  No phone number....no email address.  Their website is horrible to navigate and doesn't even give an opportunity to speak to anyone.  I tried to dispute with PayPal and they said through Uber, they have determined that I did authorize the purchase.  Needles to say, I will be writing PayPal's review next.",
0,"While I enjoy using Uber for traveling the convenience is nice to have.  While most of the drivers are friendly it's really only convenient in down town areas where you don't have to travel far.  I'd use them for work but it would be quite costly for a daily convenience. I work partial swing and I'm not sure who would be up at 1 am to get me home.  They only send 5 star drivers out.  I would love to dock a star to some drivers that have really filthy cars but if their car is their income source you can't.  There's really no way to leave feed back about that either.I never let an Uber driver pick us up at our house. I wait at the main drag to the complex entrance.  I've heard too many Uber drivers heading back and robbing the place.  I found Uber is really only convenient for traveling around a big city. If you are outside of the city it costs a bit more.  We have used them for trips and they were wonderful.  No communication, no worrying about tips and no chance of being dropped off at the wrong location due to the language barrier.  The app does all that for you and all you do is tap for a pick up request. Thank god for Google Maps.I prefer them over our local taxi cab drivers as most of them scare the hell out of us. Local taxi cab drives drive insanely fast, do unethical/safe maneuvers while driving, or turn the meter off (which is illegal in any state) and start shouting flat fee rates.  If this ever happens to you ask them to let you out where you are.  If they're an ass about the whole situation don't even pay them and contact their supervisor immediately to the company they are with.  This by US state law it is illegal to turn off the meter at any point a passenger is in the vehicle.  Report them to their manager after they leave. Request an uber or lyft service instead.",
1,I've used Uber in various countries this year and service was good. Perhaps they should enhance their customer service.,
1,"I left my phone in the car during my last ride. I have been trying to contact them through the website for 12 days with no luck. It is obvious that every response is automated, and there is absolutely no way to reach a human at the company as a rider. Uber... where are you? You have failed me. I need my belongings returned.",
1,I was charged four times for one trip each of them different prices. I had to write a complaint to the bbb to in form them. Next im going after the driver since uner cant seem to be reached I will never ever take uber again and when i take lfyt ill use a dummy debit card so that only the amount i owe is taken off. Im not done going after uber though. I will be getting my money back and this is not the last place this will be posted. Ill be posting every where i can with screen shots of the money this company stole,
1,Uber does not keep record of the destination address you put. The driver can put whatever destination address she/he wants and you will not get your money back if you get charged your coriders' fare. I was told they did not have a record of the the destination address I actually put.,
0,"I requested a ride from Fort Worth, South Henderson Street to Irving Texas. The upfront fare they showed is 40.50 for economy ride and they said I have an offer of 25% max of 10$ per ride discount so it will be 30.50, then this driver Aashish in Toyota Corolla ** came and literally said â€œOh I was going home"" and I got a ride which is exactly close to my home that's convenient for him he said and then he took his own favorite route as per his wish and then at the end they charged me 8.96 dollars extra apart from 30.50 saying the toll charges, which means the total fare is 49-50$?? In a non busy period, that is never a fare till now. It's maximum 35-36 and or 38-39 in a busy time.",
1,"Earlier, Uber was great. They used to provide prompt customer service and quick redressal of issues. Now, there is no person you can speak to, there is no acknowledgement even if you complain and random multiple charges are being deducted for the same trip. Thank God for Ola, otherwise UBER is such a scam.",
0,"Uber is the worst, they charge for everything.  They allow their drivers to say that they are at the destination so that the customer is charged a waiting fee.  I was literally waiting on the driver outside for 7 minutes because he was at the wrong complex and i get charged a waiting fee.  To top it off uber allows their drivers to text and drive. I sent the pics to uber, and they stated that it is not a cause to be alarmed. I have more, but it keeps freezing when i upload more pics. Alot of the uber drivers are rude and uber doesnt care. Uber only wants your money",
1,"I have been using Uber as a rider from 2016 with a good passenger rating. Never had issues with any driver and my experience was in general good. A month ago Uber disabled my account. I reached customer support and after a few email exchanges, customer support sent me a rude (and offensive) email that I have violated the terms and conditions. I can safely say that this is truth challenged. I have no duplicate accounts, I am quiet as a rider and cooperative and never caused any issues. I asked customer support if there is a mistake and if they can lift the suspension but they ignored my request. This is no way to treat a client. Uber deals with problems because it cannot handle the vast clientele it has currently and makes mistakes, but this is no way to treat someone like this. I believe that TLC should investigate further how Uber is operating in terms of customer support, as well as monitor it much closer.",
1,"Uber Eats cancel order without refund. @UberEats Hi friends. Don't order any food from Uber Eats. He will get your money and do not deliver your food, That is my experience and story. It can be with you and Its customer support will not resolve your problem. The delivery boy did not come at my home.",
0,"I took Uber from IGT 1 to Sector 25 Noida and it shows rent of 820 approx. on Uber Premier, which looks good but when I reached my location without any stoppage driver asked me to pay 1210 rupees which is totally disappointing for me as prepaid taxi outside airport is even charging 950 rupees. But when I cross checked with my trip charges then I was shocked to see billing of 835 is showing on my app. I asked the driver to talk to Uber and check the same but he refused and asked to pay his charge as per his Uber application and write mail to Uber for the claim. I do took pictures of driver's mobile application screen and there is no transaction or reference number to track. Only amount, date, location is shown in it and same is with my trip detail in my Uber app. When trying to download receipt of this trip it's not opening as Uber Lite is not supporting this function. When trying to download Uber application it's not getting download.",
1,"So my husband and I thought to let everybody know about our experience in New Orleans with Uber. We will never take Uber again. We went on vacation to New Orleans to take a cruise. We arrived the day before, The suggestion from our travel agent, just to make sure that nothing went wrong. We are new to Uber and our ride from the Comfort Inn Suites at the New Orleans airport to the Port of New Orleans on Feb 7 was the first time using Uber. This was at the suggestion of the Comfort Inn Suite and we were happy with the service that was provided to the Port of New Orleans. Mileage of 14.34 and drive time of 36 minutes as recorded with a value of $21.78.",
1,I was in Montreal last week as it was raining. Wanted a quick ride to my destination so booked an Uber. The amount displayed was between 27-35 (which included surge). I didn't mind it as I was running late and wanted to get to the destination on time. Unfortunately there was an event taking place at the location and the cops had blocked some of the roads - due to heavy traffic and roads being blocked it took me 50 mins to get to my destination as opposed to 20 mins and to my surprise at the end of the ride the driver told me there is waiting time added to it which I wasn't aware off as Uber doesn't tell you the amount right away. You don't have the visibility as you do in most cabs. You can see the meter and make a quick decision of either taking the ride or stopping it right away.,
1,"Launched app, was quoted $47 for the 30 mile ride home, what I expected, and what I've paid generally dozens of times. Got picked up and was later billed $133. Triple the quote. Uber says I confirmed the change. I did not, nor would I ever do so. I could have taken a limo for less than that. Dispute denied, just shut up and pay. I fired Uber, and will never use them again.",
0,I placed an order on Uber Eats and the food never showed up but I was charged anyways. I called to tell the customer service reps but they ignored me. The food never showed up and now I can't eat my lunch because I gave my last money to eat today. This is completely unfair that my food never shows up and I still got charged! I want my 13 dollars back!,
1,"Customer service is absolutely terrible. I have recently been locked out due to some background check. In the middle of a fair mind you. I recently relocated to a different state and have a different driver's license. The old state driver's license was still active in my account but due to it no longer being a valid license, and I supplied the new one, the background check failed and now I have to wait 7-15 days for a resolution.",
0,On Thursday 27/06/19 I lost my wallet with a significant amount of cash and important identity cards and ATMs. Tried to call Uber. There are no customer helplines. Uber allows to connect to drivers but the driver had picked other rides and so that leaves me knowing that the next rider might have taken up the wallet but I can't do anything about it.,
0,"Drivers take longer routes just to charge you money and they don't give you, your money back. I had the worse taxi experience with this company, driver turn all the way around and they charged me distance and long and they didn't want to give me my money back.",
0,"I ordered an Uber around midnight, it said it was going to take 9 minutes so I waited, left the club with 1 min to spare, saw the car pull up, got in, only to be told the taxi wasn't for me - he hadn't even asked my name!. He said he wasn't taking me and to get out and drove away. I looked at my phone and it came up driver has cancelled. My original ride was going to cost Â£20. I tried to book another Uber and the price had been upped to Â£40-50!! I had to go home late at night on the tube with a walk at the other end which I didn't feel comfortable with.",
0,"On 6/22 at 2:45PM I took an Uber. The driver (""Salaheddin"", who was a much larger man than me and could easily have removed me from his car) claimed that I was drinking in his car in the middle of the day and spilled it all over his seat. I demanded Uber refund the money and they showed me a picture of a cup with some liquid on it, and a car seat cover with some liquid on it. Probably not even his car.",
1,"Uber's customer service department is absolute GARBAGE! All i needed was help changing my password because someone had hacked my account. They wanted information like my social security #, which I was not going to provide. There is no # to call them unless you pay for a premium membership - so i went to their chat support. 7 representatives came into the chat and left immediately without resolving my simple request! Or giving instructions on how to change my DA*N password! Lyfe will have my business from here forward.",

1,I was charged 60 dollars for a ride that was only 16 dollars. I was also put through hell just to get in contact with their support team who did nothing to credit my account. I was then told that it was given in UBER credit after they overdrafted my account. I am very upset that my issue has not been resolved and it happen a week ago. Bad customer support.,
1,"I usually don't use Uber but I went away and had no one to take me. I had a Uber gift card but not enough money for both ways. Instead of using the balance on the gift card and charging the rest to my regular card, they did not bother to charge my gift card. They refuse to give me a refund. Customer service is the absolute worst because there is absolutely no number to call. It is by email only. This company is ridiculous and I would find another company to use.",
1,"2 fraudulent trips on bank acct. Called Uber. Support only available thru app. I don't do data. Went to website. First time ever. My email was already in use. Used forgot password option 3 times. They sent LINK to reset password. I used it. Then a 4 digit code was required to complete password change. There was NO code in ANY of my emails from them. Can't sign in. Can't try to get my money back from the fraud. Bank still to investigate, but they had advised me to call Uber about it in case their investigation (claim) provided no results for me. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!",
1,"My first experience did not go well. I'm in Waikiki and needed a ride from a hotel to a restaurant for a scheduled luncheon. The app worked well and the driver was to arrive in 3 minutes. There were pick-up time adjustments as the 3 minutes passed and 15 minutes elapsed. We are now late for the luncheon when a text is received from the driver that he cancelled our ride. A new Uber request is sent and a driver dispatched with a, ""be there in 3 minutes."" No Uber after 6 minutes; however, the driver telephoned to indicate she was lost but should arrive soon. We stayed in touch by phone discussing her locations location as updates were provide. The car finally arrived and on our way to the luncheon arriving 50 minutes late. My return to the hotel from the restaurant went well.",
0,"I booked an Uber ride and the driver immediately accepted the trip. The app showed me that the driver is very close to my starting point, but I could not find him anywhere. Then within seconds I received a notification saying that I am in the trip and will arrive at my destination soon. But I was still waiting at my starting point waiting for the driver to arrive. I wrote to the driving asking him where he is. No reply, and I could see him moving towards my destination.",
0,"Apparently, it must be an easy way for Drivers (and Uber) in the Miami, Florida area to make a quick buck without working, as I was hit with not one, not two, not three, but SEVEN bogus charges within the span of 2 weeks. The game apparently works like this: you request a ride, the driver accepts the ride request, the driver gets near the pickup spot, cancels the request, charges your card for the cancellation (hoping you never notice the charge), then goes on to his/her next victim in the area.",
1,"I have a temp medical condition that prevents me from driving, still have to do errands. Taxis in my area are unreliable & don't take cards. So I thought I'd try Uber. Downloaded their app , entered info they asked for ; scheduled a car , waited past due time , got a cancellation notice for no funds (I gave them my credit card) ; tried to re-schedule , same issue. Each time the notice gave an address 2 numbers off of mine but close so I know no car came. There is no way to contact anyone by phone or online to help resolve the issue. Never again .",
0,The two drivers in Chicago left because they did not come to the pick up area. They went to the wrong street both times. We waited for 45 minutes and they charge us $5 both times for not being there. Uber is a great concept but have horrible drivers. This is the last time I ever use Uber again.,
1,"I am a senior citizen and I tried to sign up for Uber. I went to the website to create an account. I supplied my name, an email address, a cell phone # and password. Afterward, I realized I had not used the correct email address. Thus began a vicious cycle. When I tried to change the email address, it said the phone # I provided was already in use. It kept asking me to send a screenshot of my phone. I have no idea how or what that entails. I could not find a phone # or customer service agent. There was nowhere to go to complete the transaction. I ended up going to GogoGrandparent through Lyft, but I would prefer Uber.",
0,"I called for a ride. A woman jumped in the car and they drove off despite me showing him that it was me who called. I was then charged for the ride. I complained and the fare was refunded. I was also charged a flat fee of $6.95, which they refuse to refund. Why would I be charged when it was the driver's error?! They have ignored my emails of course. I will NEVER use Uber again! I'll stick with cabs or Lyft.",
0,"I was transported by Uber a few times by the VA. Sometimes they were on time, sometimes not. I only had one bad experience with them, and was a rude driver. He didn't seem to want to take me at all. I'm sure the VA paid good money to transport me, but he was just real unfriendly.",
0,"At late night hour Uber driver after accepting my trip drops me midway in a deserted parking and threatened me as my trip was booked on online payment and he wanted cash. The follow ups with Uber and their responses have been appalling. On asking for driver contact details for registering a Police complaint they are denying it on account of privacy issue and sharing the car's name plate, an Information that I am sharing in my every conversation and complaint. As a company #Uber is more concerned about protecting the interests of their Driver Partner but not keen in safeguarding the safety of their Customer.",
0,"I used Uber for the first time, I ordered a taxi and I received messages saying a taxi was on its way only for them then to cancel it, this happened twice in the space of 20 minutes or so. It was around  2am on and I was on a dark road waiting. Then I received another message saying a taxi was on its way and would be there in 8 minutes. A good twenty minutes later it still hadn't arrived. I rang the  driver and he said he was on his way. After another ten minutes he rang me to say he had arrived! He had not! I explained where I was only for him to then hang up on me! To make matters worse Uber  then messaged me to say they had taken £4.00 off my card because I had cancelled the  ride! I then had to walk three miles home. I cannot get any response from Uber. Stay away from the scamming b stards.",
0,"I requested an Uber as I usually do and the trip went very good. As soon as I reached my destination, a friend opened the door for me to help me with my Bags. I always look back to see if I forget anything, and I didn't, and my friend didn't see anything wrong with the seats as well. The next day I received an email stating that they are charging me for a cleaning fee of 80 Dollars. There was nothing wrong with the backseats. I tried contacting Uber support but it was worthless. Nobody answers via text and they don't have any customer service number. After this horrible experience I don't trust this company anymore. I will no longer be using uber services for their lack of professionalism, and the accountability of your lousy driver.",
0,"I usually have good experiences with Uber but this one driver charged us for a cleaning fee, his vehicle was already a mess to begin with. Not sure why Uber doesn't do anything to protect consumers about these kinds of charges. We didn't bring anything with us or did we have any food or any accidents in the vehicle.",
0,"My husband and I just got back from a walk home after never being picked up by our Uber driver. She ignored our calls and shortly after canceled our ride and we got charged. This is not the first time this has happened to us since moving to Orlando. We have been putting two and two together with the Orlando area and Uber drivers. We have discovered that people put in for rides, rides show up close by but never pick you up and then either, you cancel or they cancel, either way you get charged! What?! This is crazy, we have used Uber for years and this is unexceptionable. We will not waste our money on a company that doesn't regulate their employees to pick up people or have any record of them ignoring calls. I guess it's time to try a new company like Lyft. Change needs to happen in Orlando, I am not the only one with concerns.",
0,An Uber driver was parked in a van with his door open waiting for a customer to come out. My son asked this driver to call 911 because there was a girl running around trying to stab him and his friends. This driver refused to call 911. Then this girl and a guy with a hoody on came up to my son and the guy stabbed my son in the neck and ran off. This Uber driver was still sitting there when this occurred. My son was on the ground holding his neck and blood was rushing out and he again asked your driver to please call 911. This Uber driver once again refused.,
1,"Feedback about the booking fee. Recently Uber started to charge a so-called booking fee, claiming that this is to support one of a sudden safety initiatives. What am I getting from your safety initiatives? Just another trick to charge customers more. Would love to see the list of Uber initiates they currently do for passengers. Also, there is no transparency about the fee. It should be added to the estimated cost of a trip before a customer orders rather than in a sneaky way of adding after the fact. Just very frustrating because such a reputable company like Uber make its customer feel like fools.",
1,"Uber steals what little drivers make and puts the money in their fat pockets. Doesn't even come close to making minimum wage. Uber is too busy stealing from drivers while reducing their pairing. They control your earnings and steal 40% waste of time, money and gas. You'll drive around more looking for trips than you would actually driving passenger. If you complain Uber retaliates. Uber has made numerous changes to drivers earnings while they collect all the profit including the pools that should count multiple passengers towards your quest. Instead only counts as one trip. You make less than minimum wage and isn't even worth carpooling to work. Drivers are going on strike for a reason because Uber steals from them. Waiting two hours for a passenger nothing. It's not even worth it carpooling to work.",
1,"Uber has been nothing but a headache since I started working for them. I take a 1 hour drive and they take the money away from me saying that I picked up the wrong person from a specific household to a business. Please tell me what the likelihood of me picking up someone from a house and go in one hour away to a business and we picking up the wrong person is.... Oh you say it makes no damn sense, yeah you're right. Smfh. Uber takes no time whatsoever to do any sort of investigation not even an email to find out anything at all from the driver. They just send an email saying that they took your money and you wasted your time. This is not the only nonsense that I have had to deal with. A customer broke the handle of my car and there was a huge run around with handling that. I will no longer be driving with this unprofessional company and I will be taking legal action.",
1,"My friend referred me to open an Uber account, and I received a C$10 promotional discount. I took Uber from Pearson Airport T1 to Dufferin and Steeles area on May 19. The upfront price was C$30.78, the final price was C$37.66, and I took screenshots of both. I wrote to Uber and attached the two screenshot pictures. I was advised by Uber that there is a C$2.75 for booking Fee, and C$4.50 for Airport Surcharge, and Uber replied as follow: ""The estimated amount of the toll or surcharge is included in your upfront price before taking a trip. On this trip, your actual route included roads with tolls or surcharges that were not accounted for in your predicted route and your upfront price was adjusted.""",
1,"If I could rate this experience any lower, I would. This was my first and last trip with Uber. My credit card was charged $33.60 for the trip to my destination, and $113.62 for the return trip. I contacted Uber and they would not refund the overcharge. This is certainly no way to run a business and no way to treat their customers. Terrible experience. Next time I will call a cab. Attached are photos of my receipts.",
0,Scheduled a ride to the Tampa Airport. Driver never showed up with no notice. Tried to book a ride again but web site couldn't or wouldn't supply a ride. Ended up having to book a regular taxi. Won't count on Uber again!,
1,I use Uber when I miss the bus after work sometimes. The last two times it says a reasonable price usually about 8-10 dollars. Then after booking the ride and confirming the flash new price which has been 13-14 dollars. Then it asks if I want to pay 25 dollars to get to pay 9.99 for the ride instead of the 13-14 dollar price. This has happened 3 times now. I'm sorry but I'm not gonna pay 25 bucks so that I can pay another 10 for the ride home. That's ridiculous.,

0,I ordered and had to reorder my food again and pay for all food that's were not delivered to me... The delivery guy did not make a real attempt to reach me or ring my bell. And Uber customer service is very bad. No one to talk to!,
1,"My wife and daughter spent a couple of days in Belfast. They decided to use Uber on the 1st day. Hotel Etap to Primark, journey is roughly 1 mile and had the cheek to charge them Â£14. This is someone taking advantage of 2 women on a break. It took them 10 minutes to walk back to the hotel. Didn't even want to leave the 1 star but you can't give them zero. This behaviour is disgusting.",
0,"We called a Uber, she went to wrong location and Uber making us pay for this trip because of their own Uber driver. We canceled after she never responded to my calls! We then got another driver... Crazy. I am done!!",
0,"I used to be so happy with Uber until I got a ** driver who decided to scam me by taking a massive detour for some extra bucks even though he was aware at what time my flight was leaving. I was in the car with my baby girl in the car seat trapped on this traffic jammed highway asking him to please stay on route because I needed to catch my plane. Him giving me one ** story after another and keeps driving . By massive detour I mean a ride that usually even with heavy traffic takes an hour max. With his scheme it took me 2,5 hours.",
0,"All the cabs provided by Uber in India are extremely dirty and have a horrible stench settled in them which mostly comes from the drivers. The mats are literally matted with cakes of dirt and the seat covers are almost always stained. To top it all the drivers are really unprofessional, they refuse to come up on the pickup point and if they don't feel like executing the ride, the driver ends up calling the rider and asks them to cancel the ride. Hence lowering the rating of the rider. I have had extremely bad experience with Uber at multiple times. I have been dropped in the middle of the road by the drivers just because they didn't have an internet connection to check the maps. The drivers are racist as well sexist and on many an occasion have passed very rude and vulgar remarks.",
1,It's absolutely horrible experience and felt systematic loot by the corporate whose tariff not controlled by any government authorities. Neither they care for our laws. The charge for Goregaon west to CST RAILWAYS WAS Approx 1000/- INR WHEN I GOT DOWN within 2 km they charged me 230/- as penalty. Is our government protecting our right and controlling unethical business practices of UBER? Disgusting.,
1,I have been charged several time for wait time fees. These are fraudulent charges. The 2 charges Uber refunded and now I have another one and they will not refund. How do we get to stop charging fraudulently for a service not received?,
1,After continuously reminding that i was charged more by the driver i have not yet got refund nor yet any customer executive is assigned to this matter. It's been four days. I have not received any mail regarding it. It's really difficult to contact Uber as there is no direct call center for customers complaints. We just have to write on Uber help or support but dont get any response from them. I know writing here also will not sort my issue but it's just ridiculous.,
1,"I was quoted $12 for a 2.8-mile ride that took 11 min and was charged 27.63 on a Saturday night at 10:30 pm.

I've explained 3 times that is not the place I entered and asked when he would be at my address 5 miles away. The driver cancelled my order and refused a refund. I contacted Door Dash for the same restaurant and they saved the day. DO NOT USE UBER EATS!",
1,"Months ago, I purchased & loaded an Uber gift card on my Uber app. It then refused to accept the gift card DEMANDING additional credit or debit card... Hi-jacking & holding the money I spent & entered on the app of their official gift card. Months later, I entered a debit card issued by MetaBank in Iowa & it refused to accept it!!! Now, after nearly 2 hours of trying to access my account data, it won't accept my password. After over an hour of trying to reset my password and receiving numerous reset codes from Uber, they still won't allow me access the account! What they're doing is personal data collection of phone number, debit & credit cards, email address & social media accounts. Who's paying them to collect personal data! Sneaky way of personal data collection & robbery at the same time.",
1,"Rates can be astronomical. Cancellation rates are high. Customer service support, is unhelpful, and most members are hard to understand. Supervisors are not available. Time waiting on hold is beyond substandard. Any issues take 24-48 hours to be resolved, or aren't resolved at all. Money is essentially stolen from passengers, and drivers. Any/all interactions with the company are frustrating, and negative.",
1,"I use Uber service at least 20 times a month, I was charged for an additional stop that I did not take, when I contacted the help website they were less than helpful. I received a response â€œthe driver's additional stop was justifiedâ€, and I in turn was charged the additional amount. So, I asked 3 times for a refund for the money that I added to my account for future trips that I would be taking, and I never received a response. As a matter of fact the Help Desk kept pinging me without a response. This is not the first time that this has happened, but it's the first time that my money was not refunded; it's the same address every time that Uber adds to my trip.",
1,"Uber Events no show. Let me start by saying I LOVE Uber. But Uber event didn't work, my guest were unable to use the ride I offered. Also I have no way of contacting Uber to get answers. I have searched online with no luck - support shouldn't be this hard!",
1,Uber put my account on a 48 hour hold because I added new info to my account. Uber has not yet paid me my money. Feels like they are trying to hold on to it and not give it to me. Uber does not care about their drivers at all. Uber always feels the customer is right which is not the truth at all. Uber needs to get it together something serious.,
1,"Uber is the worst company I have ever dealt with - ever. They constantly try to nickel and dime you with their sneaky fees and incompetent drivers are the worst in the business. They shouldn't be allowed to charge you whatever they want and when you dispute it they do nothing but tell you, ""Hey you have a lot of disputes"" - well hello maybe it's because you guys suck?

After that we are continuously trying to connect with the driver Satendra, who didn't responded to our calls and he immediately switched off the phone... We had immediately reported this incidence to Uber and after their responses, I personally feel like Uber himself trained them for all cheat happen with their customers, everytime just their automated responses were coming no one bother to understand the pain of Senior Citizen Female traveller, moreover, I have wrote an email to uber CEO, and found he is too least bother about customers and their issues. I won't anyone suggest to opt Uber henceforth, they are not reliable.",
1,Just not good. Try to book a ride to the airport and the app say something about invalid payment method with American Express. So bad trying to resolve the issue and still not being resolve. Better get taxi cap.,
0,"Uber have drivers going to areas needing a lot of rides, offering promotion and not paying!!! When you call to inform them they make up rules other than the initial ones. I have been cheated twice!!! They don't provide a way to legitimately complain, putting people on the phone that you can barely understand. They do not care about their drivers!!!!",
1,Don't use Uber. If you need a ride use Lyft. Uber has left me stuck in the middle of nowhere. I put $25 on my account and I can't even use it. They locked my account for no reason at all. I can't even get my money back. I try to email them and I get the same response over and over again. I will never use this crap anymore. Uber sucks.,
1,"After comparing Uber and Lyft prices for about a $40 ride, I choose Uber although the price was slightly higher just as a preference. Few mins after the ride was complete, I received an email with adjusted fair, which was $10 more than the upfront price. When contacted Uber, they gave all kind of excuses to not refund the upcharge by claiming a route change etc. Driver (a human) missed one turn and took the next one which probably change the total by 0.8 mile. Not my fault or indeed anyone's, as this is a common occurrence.",
1,"Last night I took Uber to go from SNA to San Clemente. The fare estimate included taking a route that required tolls. However the actual ride did NOT take the toll road. This is the second time I was charged for a toll that was not used. In addition, there was a 3 cent wait charge. 3 cents is not the issue, there was no wait time involved. I waited for the car to arrive at the pick up location, traffic was non-existent all the way to SC. Does UBER arbitrarily charge things!!!! When the first ride had the toll charge, I sent an email to UBER because calling them and getting them to answer is next to impossible. Anyone else have a similar experience? JO",
1,"Today evening around 8:50 pm, going from East coast Rd Intercontinental Chennai Mahabalipuram Resort in Chennai to EPA PACIFIC CITY APARTMENT which is 11KMs, I took Uber. Pathetic experience and worst thing I did. Driver was so damn rude and ill mannered and as the fare should have been maximum 150-200, somewhere between which is the unusual fare for this trip on. I paid RS 630+toll tax of 37 and driver telling me I owe RS 630 which was showing for my last trip from Intercontinental Resort to Airport which I didn't took! I couldn't understand WHY I was being falsely accused of having outstanding balance, nor WHY the fare should have been so much. Just 11kms. Quoted rupees more than the fare I already paid!",

I have tried to call the thieving company, have tried leaving bad reviews and hoping to get an email or a call. There are no phone numbers to get them or emails anywhere. I am now calling up my bank to return the charge and have disabled my app and will never never never use them again. What a crock or horse poop! Show my one strand of proof I signed up for this and how dare you charge me without me being able to call you.",
1,"The last two times I have taken an Uber from my work to my home in the suburbs they have added $2.86 SURCHARGE. The surcharge says for tolls/parking/etc so I didn't figure it would apply to me. My work is in a suburb. I used Uber twice in two days, first time at 11:30am and second time at 930pm. NO SPORTS around, NO CONCERTS around, NOTHING around. They added $2.86 SURCHARGE. So when I wrote them they said prime time/weather/sporting events/etc could be the reason??!! WRONG! Nothing near me except 15 Uber cars spinning around waiting. This is fraud if they do not have to tell you WHAT the surcharge is for?? They can't tell me why I have paid it for both of my rides. They just keep saying due to ""high volume"". So I asked when is NOT HIGH VOLUME?? They said they do not know. FRAUD. Please investigate them. Thx!",
1,"I suppose my 1st; emotional review was rejected by this site because it was anonymous. Too bad because people say all truths with 1st story. So because they decided to support Uber and not post my real-life experiences, hear it a filtered narrative. I work for Uber but before I worked for Uber I was a passenger. Uber - Passenger: Uber is pre-installed on ALL androids because some politician was paid and lobbyist got this approved. This is probably why this company gets away with so much **. Uber is a technology and is run from Philippines or India with some fake headquarters in California. I called the California attorney general to issue complaints â€“ THAT HOW I FOUND OUT.",
1,"Uber's customer service is beyond horrible. It's been three weeks and I still can't get them to reset my account. Someone answers after three emails maybe. Then they ask the same questions. And then never respond again. If you have an issue, don't expect it to ever be solved. This isn't my first encounter. My previous company stopped working with them as a business client because they never responded to any of our emails.",
0,"I booked a ride for 7:30 AM and the driver shows up at 7:05 and calls me to come down. I politely said I would be there in about 10 minutes and that I had booked my ride for 7:30. The driver hang up and didn't say anything until the end of the trip when I arrived at the airport, only to find that I was charged a considerable (almost 15% of the whole bill) fee for ""waiting time."" How is this ok when the trip actually started earlier than scheduled, which was entirely at the driver's will? Now that I did some research, it seems that in 2017 Uber added tons of hidden fees that are controlled 100% by drivers so they had many more ways to get paid more, of course by the consumer who knows nothing all so that Uber didn't have to spend a cent more on their contractor drivers. Utterly a scam.",
1,"Uber's human customer service for riders is deliberately non-existent. The only service offered is via the app. There is no way to send email to Uber describing a problem. There is no way to send feedback to Uber except via the app, and then only tightly restricted responses are possible. I somewhat get it. There are countless millions of Uber riders, and Uber does not want to spend money reviewing random complaints. But I have found no way to provided feedback for a very serious problem.",
1,"I have been a customer for several years, recently purchased a new phone and no longer remembered my password and switched jobs so didn't have access/the email connected to the account no longer existed. Despite proving my identity over 10+ emails and several days and providing a new contact email, Uber has yet to reset my account. In fact, the first several emails simply copied and pasted the website's recommendation. I have deleted their app and plan on using Lyft in the future. What kind of company can't help a customer use its platform? Ridiculous.",
1,"Customer supports are the most incompetent people I've ever interacted with in my life. After the 8th interaction, I get a new person every time. They clearly don't spend any time reading past interactions, mention surface issues, and close the case. It's ridiculous. Account payment not working for 1 month. Changed cards, reinstalled, deleted cache => nothing works.",
1,"I've never had a problem with Uber until last night. I scheduled a ride last night and it cost $12.00. When I called for a pickup they told me it would be a while and that the price went from $12.00 to $40.00 because they were busy, what B.S. So I wheeled my friend and her wheelchair at night in the dark at 12 midnight through a bad area because no one was available to pick me up and I only had enough money for the original price of $12.00. Being a female with a disabled person in a wheelchair was a very dangerous situation. I really think Uber stinks because of this.",
1,Ordered a meal that never arrived. Uber Eats took the money from my account. After contacting Uber Eats they said they would refund the money to my account. The money was never refunded. Do not trust this company!!!!,
0,"Uber is ""generally"" quick, reliable, and safe. Only had 1 driver with strong smell of marijuana in the car- put me on guard of being pulled over by police. Otherwise, drivers I've encounter were courteous and cognizant of their safety as well as mine by introducing themselves and calling me by name. I always check the license plate before entering the automobile.",
1,Firstly Uber uses an outsourced call center to receive and take calls for their company. The employee I spoke to was a supervisor by the name of JOHN who was in the Philippines. He did not care about my concerns about my safety. They are unconsidered with their employee's SAFETY. The driver is unaware of who they are picking up or even where they are going until the rider gets in the car. I have had questionable riders get into my vehicle and ask to be taken to areas that's did not feel or look safe. Ubers only consider is making sure you get the rider to their destination and not how to protect its drivers from harm while driving. This company should really evaluate the safety for not only their riders but their Drivers as well.,
1,Uber Support for Drivers is a disaster. They tell you to do the same thing over and over and keep giving you negative results. They also change their story constantly. No wonder they are unprofitable. I pity the fool who invests in this company. Incompetence is an art form at the support center. A bunch of malfunctioning robots.,
0,"After a long trip we took Uber from our airport to home. It was my fault that in gathering our things I left one small bag in the back seat. I have been trying to contact the driver/Uber since then. My first attempt to contact the driver was successful in reaching him BUT he promised to bring the bag over but hasn't shown up yet (48 hours). I have tried contacting him again through the Uber App, which is the only way I know to get in touch with him. No return calls yet. I then went back to the app and followed the ""can't contact the driver"" link and have reached out to Uber to become involved -- twice. No response from Uber. This is NOT what I think of when I think of customer service. The bag contains critical things like me heart/BP Medication and my passport!",
1,"I ordered an Uber. Price estimate was between 27-35$. I ordered Uber, and they charged me 73.00$. More than double the price estimate. There was no traffic. I took that route multiple times, at different times of the day and the maximum charge for the trip was 38-40$. Now 73.00$. I wrote to them numerous times, but they gave me silly explanation and never refunded my money. Definitely they should not charge me more than 35$. They have your credit cards, and they think they can charge whatever they feel like it. Someone has to look at what Uber is doing.",
1,Uber is allowing credit theft from companies like PayPal! Was hacked for 300 dollars in Uber charges that I didn't make! Shut them down for not able to verify payment from fraud! Do not use your app for paying through Uber!,
1,"I signed up for a ride and UBER sent the driver to the destination not the pick up point. So the driver came all the way back to get me as he said it was UBER'S fault and that this happens every once in a while. Then they charged me for all the time the driver spent both ways, I sent in a complaint and they told me basically, ""Too bad sorry we can not credit you."" They charged me nearly 3 times what the original quote was. Thanks for reading this.",
0,I have been driving for Uber for 10 months and today I found out they are not reimbursing the drivers in Hampton Roads Virginia the correct amount for the tolls. I spoke to a few reps who informed me they will only correct the past 10 days. SHAME on Uber for not taking care of their drivers and doing the right thing.,
1,"My Uber account was hacked and someone swiped $475 from my bank account. They used the Uber cash for UberEats and some rides. I contacted Uber and they agreed that since my bank card had been canceled that they would give me Uber cash credit, which I agreed to because I knew I would eventually use it. They only refunded me $225 and ignored my repeated attempts to explain that that wasn't the complete refund. After days of trying to resolve the issue, they closed my account entirely. Their ""cut"" and ""paste"" responses make no sense and now they're ignoring me entirely.",
1,"I had both Lyft and Uber apps and when I needed to go somewhere, I would compare the prices on both. In doing this comparison one day, I saw that Uber was a lot cheaper that day (which almost never happens) by about $2 something. I jumped at it and booked my ride with Uber and was taken to my destination. I paid and thought that was it. THE NEXT DAY (I swear), Uber charged me an ADDITIONAL $2 something (just about identical to what the difference in prices between Uber and Lyft were for that distance).",
1,This past week I used the Uber service twice to attend a meeting at my job. Both rides from my house to the office and vice versa were two different prices than what I was initially shown before submitting the ride request. When I contacted Uber via email they stated that the prices I showed them from my bank statements weren't showing on their system. The only price they can see is the initial upfront price before I submitted the request for the ride. This is a fraudulent company and I don't recommend anybody using their services. Uber is a bunch of thieves and I believe no one is actually at the receiving end of the emails but yet just a bunch of automatic messages. Never will I be using Uber again. This company needs to be shut down.,
0,"Most of the drivers are unprofessional. Even in summers the A/C won't be switched on and when asked, they re-confirm if we really want A/C! The most frustrating cases are where they accept the ride, don't turn up to the location, don't call, don't pick up our calls and then choose to cancel it putting the cancellation charges on us. Other transportation options are in fact becoming better where Uber is just getting worse day by day.",
1,"In my most recent requests for an Uber Ride here in April 2018, I was quoted a price on the app, and the final charge to my card was nearly twice the amount. I was completely shocked, felt deceived, and was completely blindsided. Their advertisement stating that you will know your price before requesting your ride is not true and misleading. Additionally, I was charged a â€œwait feeâ€ on these requests. How can I be charged a wait fee when I was standing at the curb when the driver pulled up? I will no longer use Uber for a ride, and will give my business to Lyft.",
1,Great idea of sharing your rides. But it is turning to taxi service which is not good. Usually good service. Convenient application. Inexpensive. Unfortunately price is going up. Can't wait when self driving cars witbe available. Robotaxi!!!,
1,"04-12-2018  Warning! do not do any type of buisness with uber!! they have become pure evil!   they no longer have customer service support. You can not reach anyone by phone and they email support team is paid by how may tickets they answer not how many problems they solve. so you get uncaring people playing games and giving you fake responses that do not help you over and over again. I have pleaded with these people and told them they placed the wrong account to my phone number and email so therefore I can not log on to see my pay tax forms or drive,  they keep sending a short response telling me to check my app?? sooo I am done they messed up my account and have been giving my false help for over a week......so please beware beause if something should happen and you need them....you get people in another country playing games with your life!!

1,The most advertised company Uber Eats has worst application and the order procedure where they don't let the customer to cancel the order but reflects on guidelines to ask on support where the customer support also keeps on wasting time of the customer during the procedure so that they can charge the price of order and then cancel it. Happened twice. Customer executive name: Saurabh.,
1,"I purchased $50.00 (paid 48.00 per their promotion) of Uber credits, i.e., Uber Cash on 2/15/19. I could not use this Uber Cash until March. My recent rides since then total $34.00, meaning I should have a balance of $16.00. But my account has a balance of only $6.00; $10.00 has gone to places unknown. There is no phone number to call on this, and the website is useless. I strongly DO NOT recommend using Uber Cash. Your money goes into a black hole.",
1,The cancellation fee should change because if a driver is 20-30 minutes away I would like to cancel because I need someone closer and you can't see how far away the driver is until you confirm the price and that's when you see how far away the driver is to meet with and you. And in most times the cancellation fee is taken out even if you don't meet with the driver and you cancel the fee is taking out the app show $0.00. And when you check your debit card account it show that it has been taken out so sometime needs to be done or changes to the app and service!!,
1,"I ordered $50 dollars worth of food, the delivery was 5 minutes away, but the driver drove past my house to deliver someone else's food so it took 20 minutes after pickup for delivery. The food was not edible so I tried to cancel the order. I tried to return the food, but neither the burger place or Uber would refund or return the untouched slop they delivered to me. They have horrible customer service and mislead their customers by not advertising ""all sales are final,"" they should be closed down for fraudulent practices.",
1,I just got charged an extra $20 for a trip that allegedly took 20 min than it actually did. I was dropped off 20 min earlier than shown in the receipt. Uber's receipt is based on false information that Uber has profited from. Disgraceful!,
1,"Have a problem with Uber gift card and it's been 2 months as of April 2018. After being bounced around from different Uber helpers via email since you can't call into uber, the problem is still not fixed with my gift card. Every response is an automate response because they never read the full compliant. Finally got move to a manager and the response was also automated. Was told they can't do anything if you gift card got stolen, when I never mention it being stolen. I have to card but then it's not working, so uber robbed me of $200.00 now!",
0,"The drivers, of course drive extremely fast. To get to no-where, then they will scam you by adding extra charges to your ride. Some will even put you out. The also have some drivers with filthy and nasty vehicles. They will hire anybody.",
1,"I ordered UberPool, with 30% discount, the ride price was $5. Uber asked me if I want to walk and pay cheaper. I didn't want to walk and price got $9. I canceled and tried again, and again, from $5 (with discount) price got $9. I was trying to contact Uber - no way. I took taxi. Now I'm trying to reach Uber to get to know what to expect and why price got up - Uber has no customer service and no way to contact Uber.",
0,"We're driving on White School Rd Sevierville 2:30, 4/8/19. Driver whipped around us splashing puddles of water everywhere. He was speeding. It was raining, and it was downright scary. A School bus was en route and this road has many curves. The UBER driver was unsafe and a danger to us, school children and everyone else on the road. I found it disturbing that nobody from UBER can be reached by phone, text or email. I think there is enough detail in my review. People need to be able to CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS. I tried and got redirected to everything but the tooth fairy... TRY CALLING UBER TO REPORT A COMPLAINT FOLKS... Let me know what website you're redirected to.",
1,"I have a FreedomPop number which Uber's system sees as a VOIP. Despite sending an email with a picture of FreedomPop's app showing otherwise and a link showing that my phone does not have a phone number in settings as the way FreedomPop works is weird they keep responding with the same message ""It looks like a VOIP"" and ""send a screenshot of the settings"" which my phone does not have.",
0,the drivers around nyc are awesome !! the service of the app is very decent but still its not the perfect app out there...,
1,"I recently had a missing payment on 3/11/19. I contacted Uber and was told to submit a bank statement with deposits before this date and after this date. I got the paperwork from my bank and submitted it to Uber. Uber claims that there was a technical issue and the payment was pending. According to Uber, the payment was deposited into my account successfully. The only problem is that my bank says otherwise.",
1,I have been a loyal customers for a few years. I take several Ubers a day spending roughly almost $ a month. I have two jobs and mistakenly put the address of the wrong job. 2 minutes into the ride I realized I was going to the wrong location. Instead of going right he went left. I told him to let me out (okay with being charged being that it was my mistake) but when I told him to stop he rode faster to the destination making it completely unsafe and dangerous being that it was also raining this morning. He left me at my destination leaving me all the way on the other side making the fare that much higher. I had to pay an additional $15 to the $7.63 I had to pay for the last one.,
1,"I downloaded the app in Charleston and didn't even get to use it before it locked me out and wouldn't let me use either mobile number to create another account. Absolutely rubbish, terrible customer service. I couldn't even delete my account as it wouldn't let me. They kept referring me to emails the support team had sent but I never received them. Totally disgraceful company.",
0,Your diver was not professional. He came very late for pick up. He took 15 minutes for 3 kilometers and he is not ready to understand my problem. I face very bad experience. Early morning empty roads of Chandigarh he took 15 minutes. OMG. 6:30am I did my booking. 6:45 he came to pick me up. It is hardly 2 minutes distance. From driver location to my pick point location. It was madness that I trust on your company and your professional drivers.,
1,I used Uber in 3 countries recently and service was totally good. They should work a bit their customer relationship,
1,"Arrived at port Columbus Ohio few days ago and did not have a ride. For the first time, I downloaded Uber app. to get a short ride home. Prior to my arrival, I was in Chicago and checked their fair prices and it seemed inexpensive.  Once I arrived in Columbus, I requested a ride which was higher by $9.25 So I thought maybe it was after hours and that would be ok. The driver arrived early and would not wait for me to get out of the airport so he took off because I was not outside immediately. I was not happy so I got on the Uber app again and requested a new ride. This time the fair was twice the original amount. I was totally upset. But who can I call. The drive informed me that they only pay him $1 per mile regardless of how much Uber charges the customers. I felt sorry for him and told him that I personally would not use Uber again.",
1,I scheduled an Uber pick up for 3 am in north Scottsdale Az for a 5:15 am plane. Uber did nothing to assure there would be a driver available at that hour. Uber simply began searching for a driver at 3 am. As a result I was forced to wake my son to take me to the airport. This is not a scheduled car service. It is unreliable. I will make other arrangements in the future. Thedaler,
1,"First off, the drivers are amazing. For one company to have so many positive and professional employees is amazing. However, I am certain that their awesomeness is not a result of the trickle down effect. I know this because, when it comes to Uber's corporate staff, customer service does not exist; literally! Their one flaw that I've observed in every driver is directly the daily of Uber executives. That flaw is poor GPS technology. Nearly every GPS app (including Waze and Lyft) is superior to Uber. This is a problem that would have been solved if the company had a customer service strategy and department worth mentioning.",
0,"Took an Uber pool. The driver barely spoke English, but me stuck in traffic, told me it would be another 40 minutes to get to my destination, told me (in his limited English) that I could get out immediately and was charged $45 instead of $10. Got nowhere with customer support. Will pursue all my options to make sure nobody else has this experience.",
0,"Someone from Brooklyn, NY driving a KIA hacked my Uber Driver account in the Fall of 2018, earned about $2,000 posing as me. Just be aware that there are Uber drivers picking up women and at times, children, who could not be approved for their own account for things like failing a background check for criminal activity, DUIs and drug convictions. Uber has weak cyber protection on their accounts and I am proof of this. Shame on you Uber.",
1,I feel like Uber should be better about not taking advantage of riders. I recently took a ride from my home to the airport. I left my home at 4:30 on a Tuesday morning and paid a reasonable charge of $26.00. When I returned a week later Uber felt like they had me by â€œthe Ballsâ€ and wanted $76.00 for the same route return. The ride there was Uber X. The ride back was economy. I call it getting taken advantage of. Get Lyft for a return option. I paid $21.00 instead of $76.00!! Talk about getting taken advantage of. ** Uber!,
0,"On January 10th I ordered an Uber, Driver requested cash payment, I immediately left the car and contacted Uber support. 3 months later on March 24th, Uber charges me a cancellation fee for this trip. I cannot dispute the charge because 30 days past the incident they are not able to make changes. Does this mean, when Uber drivers request Cash payment, we better accept it, otherwise Uber is going to charge you the cancellation fee?",
1,"Evidently, the ride-pass that I purchased expired after a month(?); the purported discount was never applied to my account, & it automatically renewed making Uber the most expensive ride option for me. For the consumer, Uber has erected obstacles to obtaining assistance. I will dispute the charges and delete the app.",
0,"I had this horrific driver named Maria Paola. I'm shocked at her 5 star reviews. When she arrived, she didn't even look at me. She probably took one glance at me, saw I was an ugly, stereotypical-looking Asian, and was disgusted. I got in, and she continued to stare straight ahead. I smiled and said a friendly ""Hi,"" and she barely said anything back. I told her where I wanted to go in a polite and friendly way, and she didn't respond. I could feel the DISDAIN and DISGUST from her through the entire ride. I respectfully asked her a question about Uber, since I hadn't ridden it many times before. She responded with curtness and condescension. I normally enjoy talking with people, but she looked so repulsed with me, from beginning to end, that I didn't dare converse with her. It was an incredibly awkward and painful ride. When we got near my destination, she rudely asked me if that was where it was. I patiently directed her to the actual destination nearby. Her condescension was very clear through her refusal to take a glance at me,   and curt answers. I could feel the disdain throughout the entire ride - it was hanging in the air. When I got off, she muttered something like ""Have a good one"" in the most robotic way, like she didn't mean it at all, and still stared straight ahead. She thought I was so gross, she never took a glance in my direction - I would probably blind her. :PThat was an extremely painful experience - but typical for what I get anywhere in SF. The disgust for what people WRONGLY see as lowly, unattractive, older, immigrant Asians is extreme in SF - and anywhere else. But, in fact, I'm US-born - much more American than she is - and probably younger than her. And I'm surely much cooler than she is. :P But she couldn't tell, and didn't want to know. I was surprised to see she had 5 stars on Uber - that means she's friendly, smiley, warm, and conversant with OTHER people. Other riders even wrote that she's ""friendly and approachable."" WOW, she was the COMPLETE OPPOSITE with me - and rude, too, with a repulsed vibe that was very obvious throughout the whole interaction. The disgust against Asians like me is more overt from non-Asian immigrants - and she must've been one, from Latin America. Uber - please fire her. ALL UBER DRIVERS need to treat ALL RIDERS with the same level of genuine warmth, friendliness, and care. Don't single out some riders for cold, rude, disgusted treatment for ANY REASON - especially if the riders are friendly, polite, well-dressed, and professional!Uber's response was uncaring and unprofessional. I don't think I'll ride Uber again. And please, BOYCOTT them.",
0,"I was a frequent Uber customer, however after today I am so disgusted and disappointed to say the least with Uber. Long story short I typically take an Uber with my daughter when I am running late. Typically the ride is only 8.50 on average when it is raining the price goes up to about $12.50 as expected. I took an Uber this morning and I had a small spill of my coffee in the rubber carpet floor. I immediately told the driver and apologized as I was trying to put a seat belt in my daughter. He passed me one napkin and I tried to wipe it as best as possible.",
1,I always felt safer or more secure with a female driver. Though I only had one guy who was bizarre I never let anyone even female drivers know I live alone. All drivers were prompt. Clean vehicles. Only one was slightly irritated because I had a few grocery bags.,
1,"We have used Uber in many places in Europe and Canada. We have had a couple of inconveniences, but nothing really to report. We look forward to some sort of rideshare program coming to Vancouver, hopefully soon.",
1,"WE love to use UBER, all of the drivers we have had are friendly, timely and are great drivers. I only rated the safety as a 4 as I hear lots of things occurring regarding ""fake"" UBER drivers. There has to be a better way of identifying the driver you are meeting. They are getting better and a lot has to do with the passenger as well.",
0,My daughter ordered Uber to take myself and my grandchildren to a meeting. The car had a very dark interior. When he stopped at light he turned on the red light although there was a sign NO RIGHT ON RED. He missed a car by inches and kept going.,
0,"Convenient, but not happy with 'peak' rates; hate drivers who rely so much on GPS; once had a driver go wrong way down one way street in NYC; hate the pressure to give 5 star ratings for experiences that are good but not great.",
1,Far too overpriced. A ride of less than 10 miles is more than $25. I live in the 5th largest city in America so not sure if this posts a part? This is my biggest reason for not utilizing the service more.,
0,"I was in San Francisco last weekend. Between my sister and myself, Uber cancelled on us 8 times. Where is the credit for them cancelling? This was a big problem because they didn't cancel right away, so several times the car icon was getting closer and then turning around. The drivers we did have were very nice but most of them had no idea about the directions. One even got out and ran across the street to ask someone. I'm going to switch to Lyft.",
1,The biggest problem I have with Uber is the difference in time from what the app shows to actually getting in the car. I use Uber in many locations. Some places don't have too many cars around. So when the app says 12 minutes but it turns into 22 minutes it messes with my scheduling. Please be more accurate with your projected time from ordering the ride to the ride showing up at meeting place.,
1,"My daughter called for an Uber pick up and was told no driver was available. She called a few more times in hopes that a driver would become available. She was charged $510 (5x $102), but no driver ever showed. Uber refuses to refund the $$. They are insisting that the refund must come from my daughter's bank. It is illegal to be charged for rides that never came. Uber repeatedly stated that no driver was available and yet they charged her anyway!!!",
1,"I tried to do instant pay at Wawa. Called. They said I needed to update my card info. When I did that it refused to let me update because of a security issue. I called. The guy said he couldn't help me. I asked for a manager and he continued to argue with me. I had to keep telling him to put someone else on the phone. I had to hang up and call back. Got someone else. He told me I'd just have to wait 45 minutes. So I waited. Updated the card info. Went to go instant pay... Locked me out of the system again saying security issue. Called back. Got the first guy again. Great I thought. I could hear plenty of people laughing in the background. He put me on hold saying it was to pull up my info, but really it was to wait for them to quiet down.",
1,They extort money from people and get away with it. For example I bought an Uber card for 40.00 and it wouldn't work. Their answer was that I owed 20.00 to them when in fact it is impossible to owe Uber anything. So money was taken from us and we could never get it back. I am not the only person that has been stolen from in this way.,
0,"I have had a few great experiences and a couple of bad experiences. Worst experience was being picked up in an emergency situation when I needed to get to the hospital to visit someone. I was in a hurry and we were already on the highway when I realized the driver reeked of alcohol and was completely intoxicated, weaving in and out of lanes and could not keep the car between the lanes. The second time with Uber that was bad was when the driver made a couple of stops along the way taking me to my destination. These stops were in a shady part of town and I was scared to death.",
0,"I ordered an Uber at the airport for me my boyfriend and his parents so 4 people and a couple luggages. The Uber pulled over, opened his truck and suddenly closed it and said We were too many passengers (which we weren't) and told me to cancel the ride 'cause he wouldn't take us and just drove off. I was really upset and cancelled as per the driver's instruction and was charged a 5$ cancellation fee. I've been talking back and forth with Uber customer service for 4 days now and they refuse to credit me the fee even though they admit I'm right and apologized for the bad experience. Their reasoning is that too many fare adjustments were made on my account (which were warranted 'cause I was indeed overcharged on a few trips). This completely irrelevant and a completely separate issue and they're nickel and diming me over 5$. This makes absolutely no sense. The customer service quality has gone downhill from before.",
1,"My wife and I are in our 70s and usually only use Uber when traveling out of our own area. Still, I'd say we've used Uber about 2 dozen times because we like to travel. All our experiences except two have been positive and those two weren't all that bad or scary just inconvenient. We flit back and forth from Uber to Lyft depending on where we are; some places tend to have more of an Uber presence, some more of a Lyft presence. Both are good values, overall.",
0,"The driver was late and he smelled badly. He was rude and a bit disconcerting. I considered not staying in the car, but I was going to be late if I waited for another ride. I wish I had done that.",
1,I rate Uber lower since they added per minute charges. Their appeal came from the flat fee which set them apart from taxis' services. Additionally there is no way to get a specific driver if you like riding with them.,
1,Thrifty for short trips when you have limited time and no car. Longer distances can be pricey and I generally like cheaper bus or rail if available. Or sometimes you can rent a car for a day for $15 or less.,
1,"Uber has provided me and my family with a quick and easy way to get around that doesn't break the bank. I have had very few issues with Uber, the toughest part is usually when travelling internationally, trying to get picked up in multi-level airport parking structures.",
1,"I've never had a negative experience with Uber. It was the one I downloaded first while in college and the one I've continue to use these past 3 or so years. Some experiences have been better than others but in my opinion the drivers probably have had a worse experience. The rides I've enjoyed the most were the ones when myself and the driver have respected each other's privacy, acted courteously and professional. I have witnessed people trash and throw up all over a driver's car, and that's not alright. I think the thing that has begun to creep into the way I view Uber is all of its negative publicity. Why would I support an enterprise that I don't agree with? It's not like I am dependent on Uber. I can use other ridesharing apps, I can use a traditional taxi, I can even use public transportation. Despite all of this, I still use Uber but that might not always be the case.",
1,Saw 3 cars on map and none would come not a big enough fair for them. Stranded handy caped passenger.,
1,"Horrible experienced. I lost my personal belonging at one of theirs Uber car and I have emailed helpline with all pictures of the lost item and drivers details. But just because trip has not been booked from account no one is going to help. I spoke with phone helpline supervisor Angela and she told me clearly that she will not get in touch with driver to ask about my lost item just because the trip has not been booked from my account besides that I have all necessary drivers and trip details. Angela told me too that Uber doesn't have complains email, how convenient isn't it. Well I think it's time to start use other apps as this days Uber is getting too expensive and as you can tell does care about their passengers and their belongings as they are only an agent.",
1,"This company should be out of business... I returned to Uber after 1 1/2 years just to make a little money to pay a bill. I drover March 9 and 10 for about a 1 each day. I made $68.27. I needed the money fast to pay a bill on Monday March 11, I tried to cash out and they stop me from cashing out... They kept saying something was wrong with my bank information... How can that be when I've had the same bank information for over 5 years and the same as when I drove for them a year and a half ago.",
1,"Some of the rides were great, some were awful. One car had no A/C, another car had a seat full of crumbs that I had to sit in, another car had all the seats slashed, another was not the car I asked for, but a very high Chevy Truck I could not get into. I had to go inside the doctor's office, where I had just left, to get a stool so I could climb into the truck. The Uber driver refused to cancel as he would be penalized, and I refused to cancel for the same reason. To end the stalemate, I was lucky the doctor's office had a stool. Uber is great for when you need a ride and are unable to drive for medical or other reasons. However, Uber does not seem to have any consensus control over the cars people are driving. Out of all the rides I needed, 50% were great and 50% were awful. I am thankful I am able to drive again.",
1,"Uber does a good job of providing the service, but lately their fares have been going up and they now have discontinued the express pool service. The idea is to give a more affordable method of transportation, right?",
1,Customer service sucks. You make a complaint against a driver & nothing happens. They work on a star rating but after complaints stars remain the same. I only use Uber because it's cheaper than taxi. Also communicating with driver is difficult because English is not their native tongue. As for the app they use to travel needs some serious looking at. It takes the long way home.,
0,"I have always been skeptical about rideshare services because of the news reports of assaults and robberies. I used this company for the first time earlier this year during a trip for a conference in Las Vegas. My first ride was excellent and was completed without a problem. My second ride was a little scary. I requested a ride but then my phone died. I was with a friend. While I was trying to recharge my phone, my friend came to me to tell me that our ride had arrived As we got in the car, I had an uneasy feeling. I started asking the driver ""who"" he was there to pick up and if he knew where we were going. He never gave me a straight answer and my friend had already told him where we were going. ",
1,"I ordered on 12 March-19 at around 12:40 PM then order confirm and then after 15 mins I received delivery boy contact number so I called him but his number not reachable and after 5 mins it's showing on the way, then again I called him but still not contacted then I called customer care. One executive received my call (VIKAS). He told me, ""Sir please wait for some time. Order is on the way and I also tried to contact with delivery person, but it's not contactable so please wait for some time.""",
1,I've used Uber 3 times now to go local places usually 10 miles or less. All guy drivers and it's definitely scary getting into a car with a stranger. I would call a regular taxi company if I needed a ride at night and I was alone. I don't trust Uber to do a good job of vetting their drivers.,
0,"Uber is great for infrequent rides like to events at small venues, trips to the airport, etc. It features reasonable convenience and cost; however, surge pricing punished folks who had come to depend on Uber for more frequent usage.",
1,"I have used Uber and always had a great driver and no problems. However, the safety of it does freak me out. But it's JUST like a taxi right? It is a great way to get around especially on vacations! So is the taxi. I'm not sure why I feel more comfortable in a cab without knowing the driver than an Uber. Maybe I've just watched too many TV shows.",
0,I am very pleased with the service and the professionalism of the drivers. I am a travel nurse and I am in different states often and I use Uber and I am never disappointed with the drivers. They are courteous and on time to pick me up. I feel safe when I'm in the vehicle on a trip.,
0,Great ride to big airport in Houston at 6am. A Courteous and very safe driver picked up in Westheimer area and driven to airport before high traffic time. Will do it again in a heartbeat before driving and having to park.,
0,"I have contacted Uber 8 times over 2 months about a driver that STILL HAS my phone to this day. Their answer, long story short? Deal with it, not our problem. It's incredible for a company this huge to provide such horrible customer service. There's no number you can call them to in Australia. Literally no way you can TALK to one of their customer service staff. Each and every single time I opened a helped ticket, it was closed before the issue was resolved, making it impossible for me to contact whoever I talked to before, and making me go through all the steps to contact them once again. Never using Uber again.",
1,Rideshare is one of the greatest innovations of our time. It's convenient and helpful to a large number of people. I have concerns about safety for the drivers as well as the passengers. The navigation also needs a lot of improvement.,
1,"Think twice before using this service. The drivers are often obnoxious or have an attitude, and the cars not large enough to hold luggage if you need to go to the airport or to a cruise terminal. What good does a Honda Civic or Ford Fiesta do in that instance?? A briefcase and the trunk is full. Would be better off using my own car and going to long term parking or taking a train. Total waste of time. And if you say something, the driver gets offended and obnoxious.",
0,"Convenient for in town trips. No issues and drivers are friendly. The value is fair, I am very much happy to see women drive Uber in our country. I wish them success. Still need to try longer distanced trips. Thank you.",
1,I started using Uber about a year ago. I like Uber because it convenient. It takes me to and from work. To the movies I use it when I go out. On The town. Most of the people are friendly and they are there on time. I really like Uber.,
0,The service has been fine in the some 20 times I have used Uber. The only problem has been with the tipping practices that are presented after the ride. Sometimes the software malfunctions and I am unable to show my appreciation to the Uber driver who gave me the ride. Thanks.,
1,They own their cars. They are clean and don't smell. They are motivated and speak to us as punters as opposed to taxi drivers who often smell and don't give a jot and often try and cheat by driving the wrong routes to bump up the fare. The taxis are also sometimes wrecks in need of repair or replacement.,
0,No problems gate codes or other info they need when getting the ride as long as I check what the app says my location is versus just pinpointing through app. Can always send note to driver to correct or clarify location.,
1,"I CALLED FROM HOSPITAL TO GET RIDE HOME AFTER SURGERY,I WAS WHEELED DOWN TO ENTRANCE OF JFK MEDICAL CENTER GOT INTO UBER CAR HE TOLD ME I CANCLED RIDE AND WOULD NOT TAKE ME HOME.HE SAID HE HAD ANOTHER FAIR AND MADE ME GET OUT.THIS IS BULL $#*!,AND THEY CAN STICK THEIR 6$ CANCEL FEE YOU KNOW WHERE.I WILL NEVER USE UBER AGAIN.",
1,"I decided to try Uber and get a ride from the local airport. I downloaded the app and booked my first Uber ride. I was watching my ride get closer and closer and I found out the name of the driver and type of car I was to be looking for. Once my ride arrived, I was welcomed by the driver that I was expecting except for there was another person waiting for the same Uber. I waited a long time for this Uber since it was 11 pm and snowing. Needless to say, the other person got the Uber because her name was on his phone. I even showed the guy my phone and when I ordered the ride which was before the other rider. I was livid. I ended having to find a cab and paying a ton more for a short ride to my car. I will never again support Uber or recommend Uber to anyone.",
0,"It is such a convenience and safety is a definite. They are very professional and they just make things a whole lot easier. They also have like discounts at times. App is great, timing is great. Their prices are just right and fair.",
0,"Drivers were close by every time I requested a pickup. Definitely a plus when you're kind of in a hurry. All vehicles were clean and dent free. As the drivers go each were pleasant to speak with. In general my experience was great overall. Just a little odd when deciding how much to tip, not sure how much of a tip they get from the company itself.",
0,Uber is very helpful for me as I feel safe knowing that someone could track who I was riding with and where I went. So person would have to be very crazy to harm me under those circumstances. I also don't have to have cash or give my credit card to an individual. The vehicles are much nicer than any taxi that I have ever ridden in before using Uber.,
0,"I use the service at least 5 days per week and generally get excellent service. And when there has been an issue the Co. has made thing right. My only complaint is that it is difficult to communicate with them, especially if it is a complaint not listed on the frequently asked questions",
1,"The Drivers have vehicles that are unsafe. Either picking you up in a car that has been wrecked, driving on spare tire or smelly cars. The drivers try and be courteous but they drive too too fast and unsafe.",
1,"I was recently left stranded by an Uber driver who canceled my pick up when he was only 1 minute away after I had been waiting for him for 15 minutes. He gave me no explanation. The Uber app automatically reassigned me another driver, but I had to cancel this one because I no longer had time to wait for another driver who was 20 minutes away. I was going to miss my bus to the airport.",
0,"I was recently rear ended by an Uber driver. I wasn't a customer or using them. The driver informed me that he didn't have insurance, so I asked to take a picture of his driver's license which turned out to just be an identification card and not a license. I tried to call Uber and the automated message hung up on me. It seems like I have to download their app in order to make any complaints or inform them of the situation. I'm trying to let them know that this guy shouldn't be a driver for them.",
0,Uber allow only drivers who been approved thru their background check and follow all community guidelines which allows passengers to be feel free with ride Uber partnerships so both drivers and passengers comfortably taking care their business.,
0,"Fun time with meeting an Uber driver. Was our first ride in Tampa, and he was awesome to recommend places. We gave him an extra tip. Wasn't pushy. Wasn't hard to talk with. Very outgoing. Knew the area well.",
0,"I have used Uber in Portland, OR, Houston and Norfolk, VA. I have found the service to be good. My best rides are when the driver gets out to find me. Sometimes at busy airports it is hard to find your Uber especially at night. The texting for the driver helps also. It was always appreciated when the driver took the luggage to the door.",
0,"Rideshare really impacts the cost of the ride, I feel it's a fantastic bargain. I am alerted beforehand of the expected arrival time of both pickup and drop-off before selecting and can easily to determine if time allows for pooling the ride. I have yet to have a bad experience.",
0,"I've had a really great experience with Uber as a customer. I've been lucky to have had professional, timely, and friendly drivers who easily put me at ease, and got me to my destination safely, and in a timely manner.",
1,"I have used them in the past while traveling to and from the mainland. After all I have heard and read in the news, I will no longer trust these services. As a senior, I worry they will beat me up and rob me.",
0,Uber is on so fast haven't had any issues with the company or any of the drivers. I'm always nervous getting a ride from someone I don't know but that is why I count on the Uber company to research the people that work for them...,
0,"I live in a small town which has typically on 3 Uber cars available which is fine. When I go to NYC, I use Uber almost exclusively because they are reliable, the app is very informative, and I can also select a large vehicle when needed as well as schedule in advance, a pick-up. I have never had an issue with Uber drivers in NYC.",
1,"I like the service, it is convenient to order food. Uber has many varieties of restaurants to choose from. The food is delivered. This is a good service for busy people. It is also convenient for getting to your destination.",
1,"I read the Reddit forum about Uber and am very concerned about what I see. Murders, rapes, fasle charges, non-show. However, I can not determine how much of this is false. Never-the-less I am concerned about the safety and reliability of Uber drivers. My personal experiences in using 6-8 trips has been great. As a senior who drives my car only 500 miles a year, I see Uber as a great money saver. If/when I am unable to drive and/or give up my car I will definitely use Uber or Lyft.",
0,"In my experience, Uber Drivers always show up on time. I never have to wait long and they are always pleasant. The vehicles are clean and roomy, when needed. When traveling, the drivers are always helpful and they give recommendations on great places to eat and different sites to tour.",
0,"I've found their service to be top notch. The app is wonderfully efficient. The ability to track the progress of your ride is very comforting. And, the prices for the rides are very good. All the drivers I've had are very nice.",
0,"My limited experience was good, having a picture of the car and driver ahead of time was nice. However, after hearing about the Uber driver that left an out of town group stranded at a gas station in an unfamiliar town then yelling political insults as he drove away horrified me. The fact that the company backed the driver makes me very hesitant to use them again.",
0,"First time using Uber on a very busy NBA All Stars day in Charlotte, NC. We needed to get to the train station so decided to use Uber - the driver took a little while to get to us (no fault of his due to all the security all around) but once he found us he was very cordial - price was right - no complaints.",
0,"I have used this service a few times, the only issue I had was updating my address. I still can't figure out where that is on my app. My delivery driver always has to call me to get my address. But other than that I feel this is a great service and it kinda sucks that you need to get a business license now to be a driver. Hope rates don't go up.",
0,"It's very clean than yellow. Driver too. Car is spacious than yellow cab. I don't have shake a hand to catch a yellow cab before, even bad weather. They come to my place directly to pick me up, and I go Long Island, no extra charge.",
0,"Uber does not address fraud. I've been trying two months to get refunded for a fraudulent cleaning fee. My son rode and I paid. The photos sent were fraudulent. The help robots cannot make any decisions and just regurgitate past answers that don't fit the situation. My son gave permission for me to work the issue but even with his permission, HELP will not listen or correct the fraud from this driver. How can anyone trust a company that treats customers with a total lack of regard?",
1,I took a trip with Uber and their GPS stopped working so he had to use MY phone and the GPS from Google maps to get me to my appointment. I was late then had to reschedule my appointment which was important. I asked for a refund but they offered me 5 dollars off my next ride. I told them I wasn't going to use Uber again because this was not the first time I have had issues using their service. They refused to refund me and I am trying to find a number to contact their headquarters but it isn't available. Terrible business and I won't use them ever again!,
1,"This was the most terrible trip I have had with Uber. This is not acceptable as an Amex platinum member I should receive top notch service as per the Amex platinum/Uber partnership program, and this was anything but that. My driver was completely lost and did not know where to go as I was only attempting to get to the airport. He says his GPS did not work and even mentioned that he hates Uber and always tells customers to choose Lyft instead. As a result I arrived at airport 25 minutes late and missed my flight. After complaint to the company for this instance, Uber did nothing except offer to refund the ""extra money"" that was unexpectedly charged due to the additional distance because of the driver getting lost. Listen to this Uber driver employee and use Lyft instead as I will going forward.",
1,"INCORRECT trip. I've sent many proofs to confirm this wasn't my trip. The pickup was ** to 59 Canal. Driver was stuck in traffic downtown Brooklyn by the Barclay, my son missed his 9 pm bus to go back to school, so I canceled the trip. The driver tried to extort my then 17 yr old son for cash to bring him back. I spoke to her on the phone. She told me to order another car so she can intercept it, I said ok. She then changed her mind and kicked my son out in the middle of nowhere downtown BK. ANYTHING COULD'VE HAPPENED TO MY SON! Now I'm stuck with this bill after I paid what I owed on top of that. I've tried to resolve this many times but, to no avail. And the driver reported a bogus trip.",
1,Uber has been ripping its drivers off and need a class action lawsuit against them for doing so on several occasions. I've reached out to them about trips I completed with them and never got paid for. I completed a delivery and was not paid for doing so on several occasions and the customer service sucks and require us to email them to get help. They ask you to wait 24/48 hours to be paid but they never pay you.,
0,I have used Uber two times and both rides were comfortable and the drivers were courteous and professional. I didn't encounter any problems and would use Uber again if the need arises. I don't have any complaints at this time.,
0,"I like the idea that you can see where they are and exactly when they will arrive. I've only used them for short distances but they're always on time, very cordial, and never driving too fast! The fare is very cheap! I would never call a taxi again, unless that was my only alternative.",
0,"I like that you can see exactly how much the ride will cost before committing, so there is no chance that a driver will drive all over town to raise the fee. I also like that I have never had to wait for more than 15 minutes for a ride. Tipping is optional, but I usually tip.",
1,"It's a wonderful concept and great most of the time. But it scares me a little bit. Ninety nine out of 100 times will be safe, you'll be so glad that you did it. But it's going to be that rare time, and has been times, when it wasn't safe. Thus, I'm scared to do it as a single female. It's safer as a group.",
0,Using this is convenient. I like the fact that sometimes when I don't want to drive I can use Uber to get where I need to go. The only thing I dislike is when you share rides you have to meet at a certain location and it confused the consumer so that could be straightened out. I think it would really help a lot of people when you're sharing rides and you're on a budget according to your financial status does. This would help improve when consumers and how they use Uber in the future.,
0,"I have only used Uber. 90% of the times, service has been excellent, car are clean and drivers are friendly and pleasant-mannered. Other times car are dirty and drivers are smelly. Next time will try Lyft.",
0,It would be helpful if the drivers spoke English. It makes me wonder how they got their driver's license without knowing English. I had one driver do a good job but was upset and I had no way to talk to him and find out what he wanted me to do because he didn't speak or understand English. Does Uber care about the language skills? Does Uber double check to see if the drivers have legal licenses?,
0,This service is wonderful when you are on vacation. Leave your hotel and have transportation easily available. Drivers usually know the area. I did have one incident where the driver had no idea how to get to an address...but solved that with my own directions!,
1,"There are too many issues with safety and abuse. After trying Uber, I just prefer the safety and predictability of a regular cab service. My driver made me uncomfortable, for the small amount extra I pay, for the amount I use a cab, I cannot justify using Uber. Maybe if I needed a cab more often I would think differently, and I do believe that companies like Uber are changing the playing field, but not for me.",
0,"I find ridesharing services invaluable. From a business perspective, I much prefer using ridesharing over rental cars and certainly over taxis. The convenience and cost can't be beat. I also often use them for personal reasons over driving myself. With parking rates approaching $70/day in San Francisco, ridesharing quickly becomes cost-effective and eliminates any issues with drinking and driving.",
0,"The cost as a rider seems to have increased. One way to work costs $25. So it would cost $300 for a six week. Is it possible to purchase a book of passes? The drivers and service have always been great, it's just the cost of the ride.",
1,"I try to avoid rideshare if possible because of the uncertainty of when the vehicle will actually arrive. The arrival time keeps changing as other passengers are added to the list of pick-ups. The last time I used ride-share, I waited about 20 minutes for a car to arrive.",
1,"My husband and I arranged a ride to the airport with Uber. We were notified the evening before our ride that our ride had been set up. When the time for our pick up, with no driver in sight, had come and gone by not just a few minutes but by almost 30 minutes we realized we had to get ourselves to the airport in order to catch our flight. This not only caused a lot of undue stress but a whole lot of money. We had to pay for 2 days of parking at the airport and for someone to pick up our vehicle. When trying to issue a complaint to Uber about this matter, they have been unresponsive. We will NEVER trust Uber again. This has NEVER happened to us with a taxi service.",
0,"I had a pre scheduled uber ride on 02/22/2018.  I received a notice that the UBER driver, Charles had arrived at my home, but no UBER car outside. I walked the block to locate the UBER driver with no success. Then. UBER charged me for a missed ride.  Bad UBER!!!",
1,"I correctly entered in the destination on the app but when the driver arrived he couldn't take me because he showed my pick up location as the destination, on his phone. So he had to leave without giving me a ride. I canceled my Uber account immediately and got Lyft, which completed my ride. Uber has no personalized customer service for their customers. It's all robotic ""check item below that best describes your issue"" then read the advice. THE WORST ONLINE-SERVICE COMPANY IN THE WORLD.",
1,Today I booked Uber cab at 7:55pm. Estimated time was 4min. He took long time to reach the location. As I am patient recently I have undergone surgery. Due to delay from driver I have to bear a pain and swollen. Who is responsible for same?,
0,"My purse was stolen by my Uber driver. I left it in backseat around 9:30a on 2/25/19, and this guy tipped myself $27 on a $13.50 trip then did extra rides for himself using my Uber account, yep he change my pw kicking me and my daughter out of the app. How you ask, because my personal cell with app access was in his car (currently using work cell) in the purse he stole. Using my locator app I saw he went across the bridge back to NJ so it adds more proof. Then he lies to Uber rep, saying he didn't have my bag yet when I threatened to go to the police he lies again saying he dropped it at 3 separate locations. So, if he didn't have it as he told Uber, why claim you dropped of a bag you never had... LIES!",
0,"Ordered UBER and driver never turned up, charged 23.59 pounds. UBER said my fault as I did not cancel trip. After waiting for over 30 minutes and driver never turned up even though app said driver 11 minutes away over and over. UBER should give the option of customer being able to call driver from app like other companies.",
0,"I don't like taxi, but I trust only this company. The price is ok and their drivers are always polite.",
0,"My driver falsified my delivery, the customer service representative reiterated obvious information with no plan of action, and the manager tried to reassure me with a 100% refund that's mandatory. By the end of the call, the restaurant I ordered from closed and UberEATS management replied, â€œWell, there's other places you can order from in the areaâ€. Absolutely incompetent company with poor standards and a lack of accountability for their actions.",
0,"Use Uber all the time and only a few times with issues. Canceled me once, rescheduled and guy still came on time. A lot of the drivers are certainly above the average cab driver. Clean newer cars, no smoke and speak English!",
0,"They never showed up for the taxis we booked, they cancelled them and then charged me each time Â£6 cancellation fee. My clients were 45 minutes late as a result of me having to keep rebooking taxis with them. As a result I lost a large contract, as well as them trying to continually take payments from my account until my bank stopped all payments. When I complained about this issue I have have had no resolution and they still owe me a significant amount of money. We will never use them ever again. Trust your local taxi firms instead to turn up and not rip you off.",
0,I drive for Uber/Uber Eats. Whenever a situation occurs and support is needed the headache begins. They are completely scripted responses. They do not actually respond to the situation but instead say it will be looked into. They then email days later and again give a script response. Never actually addressing the questions or issues. Very difficult for both customer and drivers. With customer service being what it is I would suggest avoiding Uber.,
0,"I am a Uber user and I really love using this application especially when you go home late night. Recently, my friends and I went to a house party. We took Uber to get home, we were little tipsy at that time. I was sitting in front of the car and after five minutes I told to driver that he needs to pull over because I was going to throw up. He eventually pull over the car and I clearly puked outside, the flow of our travel was smooth, the driver was fine. However, the fare was also fine when we got home. Few days later, Uber sent me an email that the driver charged me $80 for vomiting inside his car. I called Uber service to complain but they did not solve my problem. Ever since that happened, I became more careful using this application. Furthermore, I do not have any bad intentions for the Uber company. I am just here to share my experience with Uber to inform other users that they may encounter this kind of scenario.",
1,"Today we used the Uber app to try to get a ride to work for my daughter. After request, the phone rings and it is the requested driver informing us that because of the weather (winter in Michigan) it would cost us a surcharge of $20 because he had to switch from his car to his truck. I do not see how his switching vehicles becomes our financial burden. Uber needs to set limits on things and not allow their drivers to charge customers what they want. They already started charging more in general, now service charges before you even get a Uber. Sucks, this used to be a good service.",
1,"I have been using Uber for years but after a bad experience this past Friday I think I'm done. After a two week business trip in Detroit, I arrived back to the DC area and found myself in need for a ride from Dulles Airport to my office in order to get my car and drive home (about 5 miles). I didn't feel like waiting in line for a cab so I ordered an UberX. Not two seconds (literally two seconds) after hitting confirm my phone rang. I answered and the person on the other line identified himself as my driver and asked where I was. I was stunned to say the least but luckily I was already closing in on my walk to the pickup location. He asked where I was going and I told him the name of my company. He asked â€œIs that in DC?â€ To which I told him no, it is in Herndon just a few miles from the airport. He said ok and he'd be right there.",
1,"Uber, not the driver, double charged me for the tip I left for the driver. The tip was debited twice, on two different days. When I contacted Uber, they refused to acknowledge that this happened, even though my PayPal and bank account clearly show the deduction twice.",
0,Cab no. **. Driver name Anil **. I booked my cab from New Delhi railway station to my home and by mistake I left my phone in cab. My driver didn't returned my phone. Moreover misbehave with me as he was having no fear of Uber or Uber policies are in favor of him only. After that I visited Uber office Gurgaon also but no one helped me there. Also I don't understand what type of system these people are following and who is supporting this system a company where customer service is not there and there is no one to complain also.,
0,"Scheduled an Uber ride 2 days in advance to get to my airline flight at the airport. When the time approached, the app said to be prepared because pick up would occur at the scheduled time. I stood out in the rain with my bags waiting for the driver. No one showed. The app changed from pick up at the appointed time to pick up ""soon."" After 40 minutes of panicking and trying to contact Uber, I gave up and contacted a taxi company that fortunately was able to pick me up and get me to the airport in time for my flight. The taxi company was small and the owner picked me up himself otherwise I would have lost all the money for my airline tickets and prepaid hotel reservations.",
0,I made an order through Uber Eats. After waiting around for the driver who didn't respond my ordered was cancelled and they kept my money. Avoid ordering through them at all costs. They will keep your money and not deliver services.,
1,"I'm a frequent uber user and I had no problems until this uber pool decided to introduce the short walk crap. I'm always having issues with the drivers, as I see an address and the driver sees another address. And a cancellation fee? Are you serious? There are many incompetent drivers out there so why do I have to pay $5 fee when they cancel? I'm saying bye to this service and I will make sure all my friends are aware of your games.",
1,"My daughter and I use Uber frequently and loved it. Lately I've noticed that drivers are charging a ""surcharge"" and ""wait"" charge on EVERY trip I've made without my knowledge. The numbers on the mailbox on the road and house are clear and can be read from any direction but yet you continue to park and wait across the street where no one can see you. Yesterday I went grocery shopping and needed picked up. I was charged .75 wait because I had to load my groceries and my child into the vehicle... Nonsense. And a 2.25 surcharge for who knows what. I'm done being a customer. You've lost my business.",
0,"Everytime Uber makes an update it inconveniences its riders more and more. The update to the GPS has caused so much confusion for me and my drivers. Most of the time the address takes me to the back of the building I ask to go. Also this new Uber pool walking thing in the middle of winter is a horrible idea. The whole point of us using Uber instead of riding buses is so that we can get dropped off and picked up at our door not walk two blocks in the cold. And you shouldn't have to pay extra just to avoid walking, I've had drivers cancel either way so we were better off without that update. Uber used to seem to care more about its customers, I wish it would go back to being that way. I've been riding Ubers since the beginning.",
0,"When Uber runs over its customers.  Buyer betware - Ueber is not all that is seems.  At first I liked it. Ninety percent of the drivers are decent hard working honest people.  But it's a crap shoot.  I'd estimate ten percent are unscroupulous and should you ride with one of them Uber has no customer support.  There's no phone whereby you can reach the driver or company.  Case in point:  Take Bill an apparently affable guy who will offer you a beverage on the way to your destination.  Bill drives a Grand Cherokee and all indicators indicate that he is a criminal or accomplice to a crime.  When Bill dropped me off at Planet Fitness I immediately noticed I left my bag containing an IPod and Bose headphones in the back seat. About $600 worth of equipment.  I tried to wave him down but he wouldn't stop.  Since then I have sent over 30 texts to him, the local Ueber office, and the corporate hub in Stamford.  I even asked the Stamford police to investigate.  As of this moment neither Bill nor Uebr care about larceny and they have no moral compass or desire for customer service.  The car will get you from point A to poing B but after that your on your own.  Uber won't lift a finger to help.  Do you reaally want to take a chance with this company when you have your wallet, or keys, or handbag, or smartphone, or lose engagement ring on your finger? The smart answer is no. Bill is still out there. Lyft is the same as Uber.  I'll check later today but smart money says they are much more conscientious than Uber who thinks its customer service is of no importance, even when expensive items disapper in one of their cars.",
0,"I was in Madrid with my wife and it was around 8 pm in front of El Corte Ingles, big store like Macy's, so we decide to call Uber for get a ride to the hotel. We wait over 45 minutes, Uber never arrive. But the surprise was that Uber charge to my credit card $ 7.00 Euros ($9.00 US money twice total $18.00 US). On top of that they said that I took the ride to my hotel and the place another charge for $69.00 US. I dispute to the Bank of America for over two months, finally the bank say I have not prove of been or not taking the ride, therefore, ""Sorry we can't give you the refund."" So the Bank of America protect Uber, not the customer and to me Uber in Spain is totally a scam. Taxis in Madrid are excellent, inexpensive courteous driver and the best is that they're all over the city of Madrid.",
0,Uber is the worst service provider ever. I booked a cab from Yeshwantput to Marathalli which cost 320-350 RS. The driver stopped the cab after few min in a highway and said he cannot go any further as the mode of payment was online and he doesn't have the money to put petrol. The trip cost me 80 RS and after then when I booked another cab I had to pay 550 so in total I had to pay more than 600 rs. I want to know who will pay the extra charge that I had to bear.,
0,"I have had some very positive experiences with Uber, but two experiences were terrible. The first bad experience I had was a driver criticized me for not being able to drive myself. The second happened this morning (1/6/19). I had ordered an Uber at 7:02 a.m. and saw that the driver was only six minutes away which would've been more than enough time to get me to work at 7:30. I kept an eye on my Uber app to see how close the driver was and noticed at 7:10 they were about a block away. I waited in front of my house for 22 minutes and when I saw they hadn't moved since 7:10 I was forced to cancel my ride and call a taxi. Not only was I 15 minutes late to my job, but I was also charged a cancelation fee.",
0,"Charged a no-show fee for a malfunction in driver's Uber app.   (3rd person button in shared ride wouldn't light up so the ride wouldn't start.)  Driver tried to fix the glitch for 10 long minutes.  Then he said nicely, we would have to all get out and start our ride search over again.  (in frigid weather at Laguardia airport.)  We were all charged a no-show fee.  My co-rider found no way to contact any customer support at UBER.",
1,"Girlfriend ask me to send her an Uber, so l ordered the economic or pool which US$3.30. l provided the exact address of my girlfriend which was going to ride to my apt. Well after a while UBER sent me a text that the ride was canceled by driver, and also to try one more time with another driver. Well l tried, so finally succeed, but the driver could not find the address l provided. He went to another address, but finally reached the destination provided. l called the driver and he told me that he was sent to another address, but the address l provided was accurate. But as l said before, finally reached my girlfriend and brought her to her destination.",
0,"Uber is a great business idea, in theory. Employ ambitious people willing to provide a cheap taxi service using their own vehicles for those brave souls willing to get into a stranger's messy car with the expectation of getting to their destination alive and in one piece for an agreeable price. Less costly than a limo, and far better than collecting returnable cans and bottles from the roadside for those seeking easy cash income. Win-win, right? Not so fast. Without delving into the obvious, the possibility of slipping into the back seat of a serial killer or the rolling annex of a hoarder's hovel, allow me to address the drivers here, who have only recently been permitted to receive and expect a TIP from their passengers, in addition to their 70% share of the cost of an Uber ride from their (yes, brave) fares.",
0,"Ordered food through UberEats. Driver ran away with food. Uber charges me for the food anyway stating that's their policy. Contacting customer service certifies that there isn't a concept of service, the agents only correspond via email and have kept on sending generic comments without attempting to understand what may have happened. Every correspondence is abruptly closed without any resolution. When I posted a review on the Google play store, the company immediately responds that I can contact them for assistance. When I did that the same circus started again. This is the worst customer service by any standard.",
0,"On Tuesday December 24, 2018 at about 5:37 am I opened the Uber app on my tablet and immediately confirmed a pick for $13.92 (pool). The car came by at about 5:39/5:40 am. Slowed down as I was approaching, sped off about a block, slowed down again and did a u-turn to the opposite side of the street. All this time I began running after it. I caught it at the stop light, opened the door and got in. He claimed he did not see me coming after him. This was strange, the street was empty, early morning and with my hands waving I was unseen? God bless there was the stop light that have him came to a complete stop.",
0,"My daughter used Uber services to take a ride to her destination in Philadelphia. After exiting the car and crossing the street, the Uber driver hit her with the car knocking her to the ground. Once she got up, the Uber driver returned to her car and drove away, leaving my daughter standing at the curb. Unacceptable. Highly recommend not using over services. Only reason I am giving this one star is because it will not let me proceed with this comment without giving it at least 1 star.",
0,"I scheduled a driver for three hours away, for when I needed to go to the airport. One showed up immediately, and then charged me a 'cancellation fee' for not being packed. Uber said they would cancel it. But they only gave me a credit toward a future ride. They refused to refund it, as any ethical company would do. So they made a big profit of $6 on the deal. Because I do not deal with unethical companies. Lyft is just fine.",
0,"I took a ride on Sunday evening and didn't touch alcohol that night, absolutely no incident happened inside the car that night. Today I am being charged 150$ for a cleaning service!!! Drivers are scamming customers, making up stories so they can get extra cash. Uber should be ashamed of the service that they have been providing. It's very unethical and embarrassing for the company to keep people like that.",
0,"When I scheduled Uber to pick me up at 6AM and take me to the airport, the instructions I received stated that the driver would arrive between 6 and 6:10, and I would be charged every minute I was late. The driver arrived at 6am, I walk out at 6:05 only to find that the driver left!!! Luckily, I had a car and there was enough time to drive to the airport and park my car. Otherwise, I would've have missed my flight!",
0,I have been riding Uber premier cars for the past 2-years in various Indian cities. What I have seen is that the 100% of Indian Uber drivers as all the other taxi drivers in the country do not close their windows and use air-conditioning or heater (in winter) when they are not on a trip with their riders. The Uber drivers thus maintain a filthy interior with dusts of all kinds on all the cars along with mosquitoes freely 'roaming' inside the cars.,
0,"Recently bought an Uber with a few friends in Grand Rapids, MI. Once we got in his car he refused to drive us anywhere unless we gave him extra cash. My friend refused to let us give cash because she recently had been in another Uber in New York City who demanded extra cash and then kicked her out of his car. Never riding Uber again.",
0,"If your son/daughter uses Uber - beware. My son recently used Uber and was charged a $150 cleaning fee. The driver submitted pictures taken from someone else's ride, and claimed the mess was made by him and his girlfriend. He contacted Uber to refute these charges, and told them to check the date and time on the picture. Uber said they didn't have that information. Apparently they believe whatever their drivers tell them. He went back and forth with Uber. Finally, I sent an email and told them the driver would have that info, and we would seek legal counsel if necessary. They soon refunded his money. On a Google search, I found out many Uber drivers do this. They often set up their car to show a mess, use the same pictures over and over again, and even have a bank of ""messy car"" pictures they submit. My advice - take pictures of the inside of the car before you leave.",
0,"No show. Never again. Airport. Uber booked for 0815. 0810 driver cancelled. 0815 booked another. 0840 driver phoned - can't find the address. 0850 driver cancelled. 0855. Panicking. Tried again. 0915 Uber arrived, not mine. Driver said would cancel client and take me for 30 euros.",
0,"I needed to grab a ride in pouring rain for 3-4 blocks. I'd been given a code for discount ride that was never credited. Then found another charge of $40 on my card. When I made a complaint their answer was I had made a mess requiring cleaning. First off there is no way I'd made a mess with 1 small bag and just sitting there. And if I got seat wet, well it's pouring rain! I could of gotten entire car cleaned for that much. I'm handicapped and on a fixed income. This extra fee causes a hardship and actually takes food from my table. I've used this company for years and have had good and bad but this is robbing me and taking advantage of a trust with my bank info. Company cannot be trusted.",
1,"I schedule two Ubers for a trip to the airport for a group of 6. The first Uber arrived and took half of the group. The second Uber was late. As per their policy, I was credited $10 for being late. I could see the Uber coming up the street, then turn around and cancel us. He said he had car trouble. My guess is he had just been notified he lost $10 for running late and decided not to complete the ride. There were no other rides available for more than an hour. We had to drive ourselves and pay for parking for the entire trip, plus pay for the additional Uber which we would not have needed if I knew we were driving ourselves. Uber just sent a canned response/apology. Unacceptable service!",
1,Their price is too high compared to Lyft so I stopped using Uber. I had scheduled times to be picked up early for work and still was late because the app kept switching drivers and I scheduled the ride for the next morning so I had to actually get a Uber a hour before I have to get to work to be there on time.,
0,"After an hour of waiting for our food, Uber tracking online said it was delivered but no food. Contacted the restaurant, they said not their problem but did give us the driver mobile number, We rang the driver, and she said that she couldn't find the address so she binned it. Submitted a complaint via Uber forms and no response. We will no longer use Uber Eats... It's a pity because the Uber taxi is a good service but I may need to cancel my account in protest.",
0,My elderly mother took ill and was hospitalized. I immediately booked a bus to head to the state she resides as I have moved away. The driver came to my neighborhood. I called to guide him to my home and he cancelled causing me to not be able to make my bus on time and unable to get a refund on my ticket. I am out of $70 bus fare with Uber basically offering no help or a solution. I was unable to spend for another ticket which leaves my mother to go home without care upon her discharge. The driver should be made to pay for my financial loss as people depend on their services. I was given no assistance and told they were unable to do anything about my financial loss.,
1,"Sketchy minivan came to pick up my mom and me up in a dark, isolated place where they never would have known there were people waiting for an Uber. A large good looking ** man (about 35-40ish) that had the likeness of an '80s rapper got out of the front seat, sat in the back and motioned for us to get in. The driver, a Pacific Island or Asian descent man (about 40-45ish, or more) who had the likeness of the guy from Fantasy Island looked nothing like the photo of the driver in the app and didn't respond to the mentioned name. Wrong car. Set up like a ride share in the Maryland Baltimore area. Driver not the driver in the photo in the app. Driver did not respond to his name or know my name. What the heck, Uber?!",
1,"I would like for everyone to be safe for the holidays and also I wanted to share my HORRIBLE experience with Uber Atlanta Uber/Lyft Drivers United. So I was headed home from work and I rake a Uber from the train station and the Uber driver got ready turn in the neighborhood. And I told him this is the wrong neighborhood and Uber driver tells me, ""I'm following the GPS"" and proceed to go in the neighborhood and pulls up to a house that was also not mine. I then told him once again this is not where I live. And moral of the story I end up having to walk home and I will no longer be riding with UBER. They are unsafe and drivers don't care about your safe. I have continua to report my issue and they did nothing about us and thought a 5 dollar credit would solve the problem. I am terrified and very scared to after my multiple horrible experiences.",
0,Had a Uber car pick my wife and self from 701 S Olive Ave Florida from ride to airport which is 10 minutes away. The fare posted was $7.55. The driver put in a false claim for spilled coffee in back seat. Absolutely false and attempt to claim damages from us. Car was clean when we entered and left. Wasting time having to communicate with Uber.,
1,"I have been using Uber for YEARS and use it often, I have spent THOUSANDS of dollars on Uber, I am DONE. Uber does not screen their drivers anymore, drivers are rude or don't speak English which is the primary language where I live which makes it hard to communicate if need be, they do not check into the quality of the cars and I know this because I had a friend who has never used Uber sign up to be a driver and was approved after I had been picked up by more than 1 car with no ac and/or had some type of mechanical problem.",
1,"When I had to go to work, it showed that the ride would be $8.24. So I agreed, when I finally got in the Uber after waiting for over 20 mins, I seen on my screen that I am being charged 20.41! So I am livid because I did not have 20.41 to have someone drive me 15 mins! The drive took back streets and did not follow the route. I tried calling and emailing Uber with no response. I would like a credit for the amount that was originally appeared on my acct.",
1,"Like any business, Uber is all about the money and despite that fact they fail to invest in their technology. My driver drove right past me while I'm waving my arms and kept going. She continued to drive around for 15 minutes instead of going around the block. As a result I missed my bus home for the holidays because she also drove lost and ignored the route that she was supposed to take and it kept rerouting her. Uber's response? Should have canceled when she drove past. Excuse me? Cancel and gets charge her driving and Uber's GPS? I fought back and they said policies and things aren't changing and I don't have to ride with them. Yeah you are right, I don't. Thank you, next.",
1,This was the first time that I was using the Uber app. I attempted to set up a pick up for a future date to go to the airport. 5 over drivers showed up. One of them charge me a cancellation fee. One of them charge me for the trip to the airport that I never took. Once I realize that they were showing up I immediately texted the drivers and told them this was a mistake. I wanted it for a future date. They said no problem. However they still showed up and they still charge me. Do not use Uber. They are Crooks. The only reason I gave him one Stars they won't post this review unless you give them some type of rating so I gave them one star even though they deserve nothing.,
0,Requested Uber to come to pick me up. The driver never showed up but they charged me cancelation fee! Scumbags! The driver never answered the phone. They just sent me the bill for cancelation! I didn't cancel it! UBER DID but they charged me regardless. AVOID LIKE PLAGUE!,
0,"I've read many of the positive reviews and while I have had great drivers with Uber I've also had very bad drivers. It they are bad drivers and you think you can do something to get them removed from Uber think again. That's not going to happen. Probably the worst situation is lack of language skills with Uber drivers around NYC. Here is a case in point. I'm standing in pouring rain. Call an Uber says it will be 5 minutes. 10 minutes later I get a call from the Uber driver in serious broken English which took me about 3 times of asking ""What are you saying?""",
0,After ordering an Uber for a ride to the dealership to pick up my truck the Uber confirmed receipt and was headed to me. The app showed the Uber waiting on me at the pick up but no-one was there except for me. All of a sudden the app showed that the driver cancelled the ride and I was charged 5 dollars. I again ordered another Uber and disputed the charge which they refunded. The second Uber ordered done the exact same thing but I was refused refund. I will never again use Uber and I have downloaded the Lyft app for future use.,
0,"We broke down in West Columbia, S.C. and had to get a hotel waiting for repairs. My wife downloaded UBER (we have never used it prior to this). A nice, polite man picked us up promptly and we were very happy with the $10.65 fare. After renting a car and returning home I find all sorts of charges (from Calif.), including one for $6,45 and a $99.99 TIP!~ Of course there is no way to talk to anyone at UBER and so far they have done nothing but ""Promise"" to correct it. We will never use them again and advise others to stay away!",
0,"A little over Two weeks ago, I was a rider in an Uber that go into a car accident when it hit a concrete divider in NYC., myself and my friend were injured and required transportation to the Hospital. We both have several injuries that require medical follow up, my friend suffered from a hairline fracture of her skull and Spin, I have several injuries ranging from concussion to neck injuries as well as knee injuries. My Doctor wants me to get follow up care ASAP but to date Uber has not reached out to use to give us any information. We have tried to contact them multiple times and get a RoBo response that they are taking this issue seriously but nobody has contacted us or given us insurance information. This leaves us in a bind in that we cannot make Dr. apt. without the no-fault insurance information.",
1,"My experience with Uber has been terrible. There is no way to actually get in contact with customer service. I lost my phone in the back of one of their cars the other day. The only way to retrieve a lost item is to speak with your driver, however, my driver didn't speak a word of English. So I'm unable to communicate with him. Despite repeated emails to customer service explaining this, all I'm getting back are automatic reply email, telling me to contact the driver. Bad service. Will not use again.",
0,"Yesterday I took 2 Uber, like I typically (if not daily) use. On my uber ride home, everything seemed normal. I had a nice chat with my driver as he dropped me off from a 10 min ride. Hours after, I see my Paypal and Credit card statements, and realize Uber has charged me $150 for a ""Cleaning Fee"". They are suggesting that I made a mess to my drivers car. Apparently, the driver sent them a generic picture of a wet at and charge me $150. Mind you, this extra charge/modification was made some hours after my ride was completed.",
0,"My driver stole my phone and Uber did nothing about it. I corresponded with their help desk for a week and I only received stock emails. After they were unable to contact the driver, they stop responding to me but they have continued to let him drive under the Uber brand. BEWARE! You may be his next passenger.",
0,"Riccardo, Honda Civic, license plate ** in Los Angeles was to pick me up at LAX. Waited only 5 minutes and he texted me to confirm where I was going. He said he would be there in a minute. He pulls up 20 ft from me, and as I walk out from curb he just takes off. I texted him saying, ""Where are you going?"" He said, ""I don't want to take you"" and then charged me a $5 cancellation fee despite he's the one that cancelled it at the last second. Riccardo you're a jerk. Your Uber profile states you drive because ""Need clients to support myself and loved ones."" Such baloney ya loser.",
0,"I usually take the bus or train to the airport but Thursday morning Uber Express Pool cost only $5 more than my usual bus or train so I decided to go for that. First thing is that Express Pool seems to make you wait 5 minutes before connecting you with a driver. When it did connect me after 5 minutes it told me to walk a block to a nearby corner and the driver would be there in 4 minutes. 4 minutes became 9 minutes, then 11, then 16 and it became clear from the map that the driver was heading to the airport without me.",
0,The Uber driver broke my luggage when he loaded and unloaded it into the trunk. I was trying to put the handle down to separate the luggage and he said he had a better way not separating them. When he took it out at the drop off he handed me a piece that broke and said casually â€œthis came off.â€ The arena to engage the pull up handle release was broken.,
0,"Never again will I use Uber. While in Vienna, Austria we took an Uber to the city center from a Marriott. The return trip from the city center was a disaster because the driver (Suzana) took us to the wrong Marriott and would not take us to the correct Marriott. She made all 5 of us leave the vehicle. We are 5 women, all 70 years or older, at 10:30 at night, in a foreign city, in a dark and isolated area. We had to get a taxi to return to the correct Marriott. Personal safety is not a concern to Uber and that in itself is a crime.",
1,"I ordered an Uber ride today going from Lafayette Street and Worth Street in lower Manhattan and going to New York Pennsylvania Station. I was instructed to meet the driver at the corner. After waiting for some time my mobile phone alerted me that the driver canceled. I then ordered another car and it said that the car would arrive in 8 minutes. After waiting about 20 minutes there was ""NO CALL and NO SHOW"". I found myself having to take the subway of which I was trying to avoid.",
0,"I urge you, do not use Uber. They are well known but as you use them please be sure to look closely at what they are charging and when they are charging. I strongly emphasize on the when. They charged me on a ride I never used even after I said they are not authorized to. I have record of the trip history as canceled just 2 seconds of calling for a ride and they blatantly ignored it. Never addressed that this was an unauthorized charged. 90 days after this trip, I was sent an email 3 days ago from them stating they will charge me because their system made a mistake. Shortly after this, I figured out that their loophole is to close the account 30 days after your trip so you cannot dispute it then send a notification 90 days later saying their system made a mistake to a ride that will be charged 14 days later.",
0,"I wouldn't even give this ""company"" one star. First of all, their drivers always cancel my pool trips because they don't want to do pool trips and then I have to deal with the cancel fee and the trip money they take. Apart from dealing with this all the time, about a month ago I was out with a friend and my phone wasn't working so my boyfriend called an Uber for me, about a week later we realized that they had taken $150 out of the account because of some cleaning fee. They sent us a picture that looks like someone spilled water on the door and they said that was the reason. So we told them that I didn't do that and that that could be some random picture taken by their driver and they didn't care. They are not giving me my money back. They didn't even send me an invoice detailing the reason why they were taking that money, I had to ask them. So they basically stole my money. Be careful people. This guys don't care about you, they just want your money. I already deleted my account, I'm riding with Lyft from now on, I've never had a problem with them.",
1,"My account was cloned, so I have having money taken out of my account for Uber trips and Uber Eats that I did not make/have.I tried using their Uber_support twitter account, and received the same automated message over and over.I then wrote back, and didn't get a reply. I then replied to my reply, and my issues was apparently taken to the appropriate team. Who then sent me the same automated message.I tried to again explain my concerns, but continued to received the same automated message.The charges still continued to come out of my account. When I messaged them about this, guess what.....THE SAME AUTOMATED MESSAGE.Terrible customer service!! If I could have given 0 stars that's what it would have been.",
1,My daughter's Uber account was hacked and you cannot find a single number or chat to have a conversation with Uber directly anywhere. Uber appears unreachable unless you have a safety issue with a driver...otherwise they appear completely unreachable by design.,
1,"I was a first time user yesterday, using a Samsung 7 Android and the Uber app, which was set up a week ago, in order to establish an account. It was around 6 pm and needed a ride to the hospital, was attempting to schedule a 6:30 am pickup the following morning. The app appeared to provide a 'Clock' to schedule, which I used, but prior to confirming there was no indication that the time would be 6:30 am. Thinking it was a screen update issue, proceeded and the time reflected 12:50. There is no way to edit, so I cancelled immediately and tried again, paying careful attention and again I ended up with 12:50, so cancelled that and had my Daughter add me to the 'Family' option, which worked out from her end.",
1,"Uber has hold the full payment for already cancelled trip. They did not void the payment. Be careful when you used Google Pay to do Uber payments. If we cancel the trip, Uber will hold the full amount. They will not refund it.",
1,"I'm going to share a story about why I will never use Uber again. A month ago, my Uber account was hacked. In fact, AMEX confirmed to me that they had SEVERAL people calling in to say their Uber accounts had been hacked that week. Nothing on the media - strange? Within a 4 day window, 118 rides were charged to my credit card in USD - each totaling over $120+ CAD... Resulting in $8,200 of wrongful charges to my AMEX (thankfully I have fraud protection on my CC, so it was on Uber's end to stop the charges). Even though I alerted Uber immediately when it happened, it took them 4 DAYS to STOP the charges from being incurred/charged to my card.",
1,"A short while ago my social media was hacked, and it expanded into many of my accounts (Uber being one of them). I then went on to delete my account but Uber has a policy of leaving the account open for 30 days after for possible reactivation. This led to the hacker reopening my account and using my credit card. I have since had to change all my cards. After trying to find a number to call (which they do not offer for riders) I emailed them to try and get my account deleted immediately. After 3-4 emails back and forth with them all they have done is ""refund my money"" (which they said was completed, to a card that is no longer valid) and mark my account for deletion in 30 days (allowing that individual to open my account at their leisure). I would not recommend this service to anyone if they value their privacy.",
1,Unfair cancellation fees charged by Uber to customers. Uber is constantly harassing me with wrong cancellation fees for cabs which are getting booked far away from my pickup location where drivers refused to come. So I am charged fees for such situations.,
0,"I have been using UberX twice a week, every week since July 2, 2018. On Monday morning I use Uber to go from my house in Mississauga to Pearson Airport, and on Friday early evening I use Uber from Pearson Airport back to my house in Mississauga. Every Monday and Friday exactly at the same time and the same route. Every time Uber charges me different fare, not even two times were the same or even close. Last week they decided to charge me extra money three days after my trip to the airport for unknown and unexplained reason. Uber thinks they can charge you anytime because they have your credit card information. It's completely a rip off and totally inconsistent charges for the same trips at the same time. I decided to cancel my Uber account and use regular taxis or Lyft; no more Uber anymore.",
0,"Uber needs to understand that their cab pooling service is very time consuming for passengers. The drivers go even 1-2 kms off destination route to pick up and drop other pool riders. Kindly understand, this is very time consuming and we don't reach our destination early. Not like the fares are super-low that we have to bear this kind of torturous service. It would be awesome if Uber pool services are far more efficient, in the sense, each following pick up should not be of 5-8 mins of difference in terms of distance. In this way, more people will use pool services and add less to traffic jams. Uber should not just focus on making money but also contribute to lesser vehicles on roads which is very necessary in cities like Bangalore which is overflowing with traffic. Kindly do make an impact by bettering pool services and reducing cab fares.",
1,Today I booked a ride from I.D.A pharmacy. Driver was waiting in a different lane. When I finally found the car and sat in the car. Driver started arguing with me. He said that he is canceling the ride and I need to book another car. If I got get out of the car he will call the cops. He forced us to come out of the car. He came out of the car and was standing at the door until we came out of the car. How can someone cancel the ride and threaten us like this. Drivers get paid because of customers and this is how drivers behave. This was the worst experience as I was waiting 10 mins and he canceled the ride. Driver's name was Sherif and his cab number was ** Ford Focus. Trip was canceled on 20th oct 2018 at 1.28pm.,
0,I joined Uber as prospective rider in case of my car failing and placed money into an account that would be drawn from for each event until expended. I then tried to delete my subscription/acct as an experiment and was told no money would be returned nor sent to a new account once I deleted existing acct.,
1,This is the first time I use Uber. I had no clue on how to use the app. Made the mistake of ordering service hours before I needed it. Uber sent two drivers. I was able to get the first before she got to my house and cancel without being charged. The second driver had no phone so I got charged for a canceling fee because he came to my house. There is no number for customers to call for help. All they have for customers is a frigging automated machine. Never using Uber again!!!,
0,"Usually I travel to DFW airport daily for my job. Yesterday I rented Uber just as I do everyday. My driver was Glorelys. I am deliberately writing this review in order to educate consumers and since Uber has monopoly is U.S. and they feel nobody or no review can harm their reputation. This, Glorelys was new immigrant from Venezuela. I just don't want to discriminate, but because of my experience I asked her when did she moved to U.S.? She didn't know a single word of English. She was talking in Spanish with me and authorities at the airport. Though I was guiding her on right path, she didn't heed my advice since she didn't understand English. She roamed around airport for 1 hour and Uber charged me $12 more than usual charge. I was late for my job. Instead of giving me refund, it charged more for driver's fault.",
1,"After many attempts explaining my situation, it became apparent that Uber has among the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Many contacts with Uber regarding this issue, here was my final attempt to receive fairness from this company. Actually my final attempt was today, Oct. 15, 2018 where I was advised that my claim is too old, their final excuse to keep my money. I began this process within a week of the trip. Here's my story...",
1,"I ordered an Uber and the driver was very nice so I tipped him atter. I kept getting error messages while trying to tip saying that it wasn't going through. I waited a few minutes, tried again, and success. The next day I checked my bank account and saw that I was charged the tip twice. I messaged customer service and they credited the money to my Uber account. I wanted a refund because I rarely use Uber and I just wanted my money because I only authorized a one time tip. After many back and forth messages they still refused to refund my money. I will never use Uber again.",
1,"Booked 22 hours in advance no one showed up. Bad as that was, support and help department said: ""We're sorry to hear that your driver canceled your trip and that this delayed getting you to your destination. I can confirm that no cancellation fee was charged on this trip request. If you were referring to a different trip, please let us know."" Well that was nice of them. Then (obviously a form letter since I did not pay anything): ""We understand your concern. We know this is not the news you were hoping to hear, but we will not be able to refund this fare due to it not being within our standards. Thank you."" So, Uber has no policy if no one shows up after an advance booking? Won't be doing that again. Lyft next time.",
1,"I would give Ron, uber driver from Sante Fe negative stars if I could. On Oct. 12, 2018 we requested a uber driver to take us from our hotel to Sante Fe airport at 5:30am.The driver showed up, and intrduced himself as Ron. He seemed nice enough. My wife and I got in back, and proceeded to the airport. As we're driving, my wife and I are making small talk with him(where you from, how long you been an uber driver, and so on. Said he was from NY, and had been driving for uber in Sante Fe for 4 years. He started talking about tips, which I thought was very inappropriate. He said he buys water and hand sanitizer for his customers. I said ya, looks like a wet bar back here(lol). His demeanor  quickly changed. He said "" you people are invading my privacy."" HUH! You ""have no bussuiness invading my privacy RIGHT, RIGHT"" (yelling at us) SCARY! We said we're just making small talk as he continued to yell at us. Finally, I told my wife I need to record this. He heard this, pulled over, and told us to get out. It was 5:45am, 40 degrees in an area that was dark no street light or bussinesses miles from our destination.He opened my wives door, and rudely told her to get out. He threw our luggage into the street and drove away. My wife is 65, and has a sling on her arm after a surgery. We didn't know what to do. It was our first uber ride, and I'm pretty sure our last.",
1,"First and foremost there is no phone number to contact Uber. Is that legal? Second of all, I have used Uber about 20 times. Great idea but what they do not disclose is that on top of the charge that you pay when you schedule a ride they add an additional charge usually under a dollar. For WHAT? Example: I just scheduled two rides, both for a friend about 30 minutes apart. The first ride was 14.67, the second ride was 15.37. I checked my account and they charged me .40 for no apparent reason and .12 for the second ride. They do not tell you what it is for but it is an unauthorized withdrawal. Pass this information on. How long will customers allow ourselves to be ripped off? It shows how absolutely lazy we have all become to even allow these companies to continue to rob us.",
1,"I have a disability which limits my walking. I can't drive due to severe nerve damage and uncontrollable reflexes. The closest store to me is a Family Dollar which is .02 miles from my house. The cost for me to Uber there is $6.50-$7.50. Along with all other companies promising cheaper pricing to make conveniences more affordable is yet another lie. After putting Taxi Cab Services out of business, rates skyrocketed. I can't say how so very disappointed I am with Uber. I have an upcoming surgery which I pray will be a success. I would love to be an advocate for anyone having to utilize transportation services due to no available bus routes so they may travel when needed at a fair price. I use to take Uber to work, the last two years I've paid a private driver to transport me to work, which is cheaper than Uber (12.4) miles 5 days a week. I haven't been able to work in the last 27 days and would appreciate the use of affordable transportation.",
1,"Well, I went to Lax from end of the el toro road which it was 54 miles and 1 hour and 8 minutes. When I called Uber to adjust the trip at the first he doesn't accept that and he said everything calculate right but when I prove that I am right he said, ""Yes you are right"" and instead of 50.17mile * 0.87per = 43.45$ 62.32 time * 0.1125= 7.01$. And also I had long pick up fee of 5.06$. So 43.45$+7.01$+5.06=(55.72$). But when they make a mistake to calculate the ride and also the support accept that on the recording line. 53.80$Miles * 0.87$ = 46.806 $ 68 minutes * 0.1125$ = 7.65 $. And also I had long pick up fee of 5.06 $. So 46.806$ *+ 7.65$ + 5.06$ =59.516 $.",
0,"I ordered an UBER by entering the facility name on Monday. There was no issue with arriving time and price, then I confirmed it. However when I arrived there, it was not the one I wanted to go to. I definitely entered the correct facility name and the name of building I arrived was not even same name as I entered. Also I had to add the correct address by myself and they charged me again. I'm sure that the address UBER programmed into their system was wrong and they took me to the wrong place (driver was nice).",
1,"Uber has made transportation much easier, however, it is overrated and expensive. Uber only cares about $ and drivers but does not care about customers at all. First there is not a phone number to reach if you ever encounter any kinds of problems. Only 10% of drivers are actually nice and professional. Uber taking your money when the driver cancels the ride is just ridiculous. Uber should not cut $$ from your account even if you cancel the ride. If our ride cancellations affects the drivers, then Uber should be able to solve that issue for drivers. Customers should not be paying even for a single penny, if they don't use the ride.",
1,"Uber drivers made me feel unsafe. I had one Uber driver harass me and kept calling after the fact I cancelled the ride because he had me waiting over half an hour and then called said he drove to wrong place. Most drivers are rude and somehow there's always an issue with the app, then they don't have customer service or a number where someone can be reached if there is an issue. And when I emailed Uber about the driver making me feel unsafe since he kept calling me and harassing me, their only response was to block the driver or call law enforcement. They need to fix the app and thoroughly background check these people they hire!",
0,I had a problem with a driver cancelling and being stranded on the street corner with no ride. I asked support if there was any way to schedule rides so I didn't experience cancellations among other concerns. I got a form letter response saying that the $5.00 I was charged for not getting a ride had been refunded (I already knew that). The email for Uber customer service does not allow for two-way communication. I guess Uber can provide nothing and call it customer service anyway.,
0,"I used UBER yesterday for a ride to my home address. After 3 mins in the car, I realized the traffic was too much so I asked the driver to drop me off at the nearest train station instead, which was just 7 minutes away from the spot where he picked me up. My wife booked the UBER thru her phone so I assume the driver would change the drop off location on his phone. An hour later, I receive my Uber receipt for a staggering $60.46!!! I was shocked because according to the receipt, the driver stated that he dropped me off at home which is a lie. I cannot believe they would lie like that and charge me $60.46 for a 7 minute drive. I try contacting Uber four times over this matter but they are not resolving it.",
0,"While on vacation in Europe, my wife and I were in an accident in an Uber. It was clearly the Uber driver's fault. Very nice guy, accidents happen. When contacted by Uber they said they would refund our trip, duh. What about the time spent on scene (over an hour), the emotional distress of seeing the other party carted off by ambulance and having been in this traumatic experience. I was just looking for a few credits, not a federal offense. I was told there was no way to determine the amount of compensation for this type of thing. Time to start using Lyft.",
0,"I left my iPhone yesterday Oct. 2, 2018 in an Uber. Uber makes it impossible to retrieve item as you can't talk to a live person but must submit via phone (which I left in car) or online only to get a response 24hrs later it's been resolved. I asked for the driver to call me back and got NOTHING. Never ever use Uber again. They exploit their drivers and steal your stuff with no call back. Worst company ever and can't wait for them to fail. All I asked for was a call back from the driver which they promised and never did. Now I have to go back to Vegas without a phone and all my data.",
0,Uber is a total rip-off. They scam drivers every day. You always see premium possible for long pickups but never get them. This means it should be a surge because no drivers are in that area. I have copies of all the premium possible trips and never get premium but charge rider a big premium. My last one was a 2.7 mile trip that took 5 minutes. Had to drive 18 minutes to get there and almost 5.5 miles. The rider paid 14.26. I got 5.43 and that included a 1.70 long pickup! Anyone who says they aren't screwing drivers is either an idiot or a troll for Uber! That is criminal. I have pics of every one. What rider would pay 14.26 for a 2.7 mile ride that took five minutes??? Had to be surge! I had to drive 18 minutes and 5.5 miles to get to rider.,
1,"I ordered food, and it was supposed to be delivered at 6:55pm. At 7:10 the driver, Tariq, contacted me that he could not found my address (5 min from the restaurant), already on Uber website. I gave him some instructions on how to find it, and he told me I gave the wrong address. Another 10 min and he call again that he was lost. When I try to help him, he told me that he could not waste any more time on my order, because he was losing money every minute. He told me that he was canceling my order. I called the restaurant, reorder the food, and went there to pick up. I was parking on the restaurant when the Uber driver calls again, at 6:40, telling me he was in front my house and I wasn't there to receive my order. I lost it. I told him to feed the food to his dear mother and leave me alone. What a bad experience. I will never order from Uber again.",
0,"Venmo sent me an email with a code for $10 off an Uber ride as a celebration for being able to use them as a payment method. I applied the code to my account, took a ride, the code didn't apply. I asked Uber support why and they said I had to make sure payment was on Venmo. Alright. I took another ride and made sure Venmo was my payment, still nothing. Contacted Uber support over 7 times and got answers ranging from, ""we don't know what ride you're talkkng about"", to ""select your payment method to apply credit"" to ""This code expired"", ""We're unable to refund or credit this ride"". Basically, they refuse the email fine print from Venmo and don't care that there was a promo code that was supposed to work on their platform. Very poor service.",
1,I was quoted $6.25 for my ride and charged that. Hours after my drop off I received multiple notifications of a charge of $16.14 and $9.87 being charged to my card for my one ride. Yes 3 separate charges for one Uber express pool ride. I immediately filed a complaint which really only wasted my time and pissed me off even more. I was bounced from rep to rep and had to restate the same information over and over and OVER again. The last rep made it seem like she had resolved the issue until today when I saw a pending charge of $16.14 on my company card which is linked to my Uber account for business travel.,
1,"9/30/2018 Arizona Cardinals game. Request Uber driver, app says driver will arrive in 11 minutes. 30+ minutes go by, driver doesn't show up. I call the driver, he says he is on his way, 2 minutes later, driver cancels on me. Without my permission, Uber says they are finding another driver. Another 30 minutes goes by, driver calls and says he came and didn't see me and left. Said he'd come back. I watch, 2 minutes later that driver cancels on me. I wasted 1 hour in the parking lot waiting for two drivers who cancelled on me.",
0,"Today I left my cell phone in the Uber. Every avenue I have taken to try to contact Uber has led to a dead end. I need the verification code sent to my phone in order to login from my desktop. But I do not have my phone. So I cannot get the verification code. There is a page purportedly just for resolving this issue. But it no longer works. I emailed customer service for help getting into my account and at 12 hours later, I have not had a response. I emailed them all day, actually. I called the only number available. That number is for drivers. There are no telephone numbers for riders unless you have the app on your phone. But I don't have my phone. The lady on the driver line promised to help me, then she put me on hold for 40 minutes. So I finally hung up. While I was on the driver line, I heard all the things Uber is doing for their drivers, as a ""driver centric company."" They do not care about the consumer at all. This is wrong. Just plain wrong.",
1,"I took an Uber to the hospital but left my expensive cardigan in the car. I contacted the driver immediately from information provided in the app. He confirmed he had the cardigan. He said when he is back in my area he would drop it off. I did not hear back for a while so contacted him again. He said he would drop it off to me but I'd have to pay almost £45 for the trip or he ca drop it off at the Uber offices in Canary Wharf. I then asked he drops it off at Canary wharf. I also asked that he let me know the details I will need to collect the item. My fare to the hospital was £7 by the way. Anyway, the driver whose uber user name is ""Abobacar"" stopped responding to me. I contacted Uber and they said they had tried to contact him to no avail. So I suggested that they switch his access off to force him to come to the office but they did not respond to that request instead they pretended they could do nothing and that the driver is self employed so there's nothing they can do. I filed a Police report and the Police said they had a duty to resolve the issue on my behalf. I relayed the message to Uber but they declined. A few weeks after, Abobacar contacted them and claimed he was in an accident and that when he got the car back the cardigan was missing. So I asked if his insurance would pay for the missing item, they did not respond to that. The moral of the story is, if you have a problem with an Uber driver Uber will do absolutely nothing to help you resolve it. They appear to have a finders keepers policy. It is disgraceful. I still use Uber but will switch to a competitor as soon as I get a chance to find one. Also, I will send an invoice to Uber as advised by the police. I will follow up with feedback at a later date. Beware of ""ABOBACAR"" the Uber driver!",
1,"I have been driving for Uber for about 6 months now, and they are horrible. When I try and cash out on fast pay it's always something going on with their site. I really hate that when you call them nobody knows nothing. I sit online with Uber for over an hour and nobody even came back to the line. This company needs to be close because they are inconsistent and does nothing for no one other than Uber. I would not recommend them to nobody not even my damn dog.",
0,"I booked my Uber cab from Cantonment railway station to Bengaluru airport. After my ride gets started, my driver received a call from other customer for pickup. Suddenly my driver asked me to get down and book for a another cab. I ignored him and asked for the reason. Then I come to know that he is working for both OLA and UBER. The 2nd customer is from OLA request. I confirmed this from OTP option asked before started ride. Then I requested the customer to drop me first as I am already delay to my flight. Finally the driver not dropped me in the actual destination... hence I missed my flight... At last my important official meeting got canceled because of me. I am demanding from UBER at least to refund my missed flight charge 3500/-. I am not getting proper response... Feeling very bad about this... Need justice else will go to any extend to get back my loss.",
1,"I was exceptionally satisfied with Uber until yesterday. On reaching my location, my app showed a payment amount. The Uber driver requested a higher amount than the app request. I paid what the app showed, and the cash function on my account was revoked. Follow up customer service? Was shocking despite me using the service daily. Wrong platform to answer the query, electronic response. Nobody can or will assist with a genuine query. I've installed Taxify.",
1,"I have never had an issue with Uber in the last two years of using their service until two days ago, when I scheduled a ride the night before. Upon entering the details, a window popped up on the app indicating a Pick Up guarantee. If the driver did not show up within the window of time allotted, the passenger would be credited $10 for a future ride so long as it met the eligibility criteria. My driver exceeded the window of time and arrived later. As a result, I was late to arrive for my appointment. I wrote to customer service and requested the credit. The rep stated they would credit $5 instead. When I quoted their policy verbatim, the second rep stated they would not be paying any additional credit. 24 hours later, they still haven't even credited the $5. It's annoying that as a loyal user with a pretty good rating can't even get something like this resolved, and in line with Uber's policy.",
0,"No problems with the riders. Uber app charged the incorrect card at the end of the ride, despite profile setup. No big deal here. I requested the charge to be switched to the other in the account and they could not make this basic transaction in more than 10 days I left the ticket open. My periodic follow-ups were useful only to be told that a specialized team was looking into it. I never asked for troubleshooting details but only for the charge to be switched between the cards registered in the account. Customer service just bounced me back every time with no excuse, given the type of request. I could not add that ride to my expense report in time to be reimbursed by my company as it was a business trip. Thanks Uber for that!",
1,"Worst case scenario with Uber is that they don't have customer care number available in India. I paid twice for a ride as I have booked a ride and paid via my debit card and transaction had done but Uber shows me an outstanding payment of my ride and when contacting them via email they response very slow. Plus when I finally got a call from them they said, ""We have blocked your card and to remove that send us the transaction script"" and even after sending them they said that it's not proper and after sending them one after another mail but still I don't get any reply. I am very much sure that Uber should be banned in India till they got a customer care office in India.",
1,As Uber driver in North California. This is second time happen to me in within six months. I got a text message from Uber says they identified improper use of the app as a result they remove my promotion from my earning period and will deactivate my account if similar problem occur again. I talk to support customer service. They send my case to an expert and after waiting for 36 hour for their reply and demand them to explain to me what mistake I have done in order to avoid doing it again because I really care about my job as Uber driver. They seem to be careless and sent me same message. They send earlier like robot message.,
1,Uber driver stopped then drove off without explanation and cancelled my trip once he saw my grandmother was in a wheelchair. When making a complaint they said they would look into it but could not tell me the outcome. Disgraceful company.,
1,"I book cabs through Uber app a lot many times. Some experiences was good some was bad but my recent experience with Uber was just nuisance. I have to take my sister to the hospital as she was not feeling well in the evening, so I booked a cab via uber. The distance was hardly 3-5 km from my pick up location to my destination. First it took 10-15 mins to connect me with one driver when my pick up point is very near to the main highway (less than even 1 km). And 10 around cabs are always available in this area.",
1,I was given a fare of 6.31. I was billed 26.31. After I reviewed my trip my destination address totally wrong. I have been writing back and forth with them for 2 days. Now they cannot seem to get it right. I was wrongly charged again after their review. Was given a partial refund. Then they wrote me saying I will get the rest. I am still waiting. This is just a unneeded pain in the **. Horrible cust service. I will be trying Lyft.,
0,"Customer service on the part of Uber completely sucks. Had problems requesting a ride twice that system errored, got locked out of my account because of your errors. Went through help to unlock it and it errored twice. Again same EXACT problem. Tried help again. ZERO response from customer service the second time even after following your prompts online. Bad for business when people are trying to use the service first time on vacation. Ended up having to use taxi service. It's over 12 hours later and STILL no response from Uber. Hope they end up out of business. Will certainly be reporting poor ratings anywhere & everywhere I can including BBB & state attorney general.",
1,"As a rider all is somehow ok but as a driver this company is the biggest scam ever... They will use you, abuse you and throw you like a piece of trash after you get just a couple of traffic tickets, claiming on your driving record that even the non moving violations are moving violations for them... This nasty company full of thieves will steal drivers' tips and tolls and squeeze out of you and your car all they can before kicking you away...",
1,"In June, I ordered an Uber car to pick someone up at Marseilles Train Station and bring them to an address that was one hour away. The screenshot of their quote showed that the cost would be between 192 and 254 Euros. There was absolutely no mention of a surcharge. They then charged me 471.02 Euros ($742.47 CA) saying the ride was at a high traffic time. It was 10:30 pm at an almost deserted train station.",
1,"While traveling Europe I spent over 500 Euro with Uber. They overcharged me on 25% of the trips I made compared to the quoted price given on phone app, after the ride was completed. One instance they quoted me 40 to 50 Euro and charged me 70 Euro! Over a 100 Euros were spent from overcharges compared to their quoted phone app price. This seems very dishonest to me.",
1,A promotion was offered in my area to sign up as a driver for uber 200 dollars extra if 100 rides were completed in a month... I completed 100 rides in 10 daysbut never recieved my bonus... So i called uber driver support... Who hung up on me 3 times then transfered me arround their office as i asked to speak to their managers... With them all saying i never opted into that bonus program so i wouldnt be getting it... After i asked to speak to a manager for the third time the male i was speaking to said he was the highest up in management and that he had herd my problem amd wouldnt be doong a thing about it and that he didnt have any more time to spend on the phone with me and he hung up again....

1,"Humble, Texas. September 15, 2018, I ordered a ride and was picked up by Edwin, driving a Toyota Corolla. The ride was quoted as $11.45. Later that evening, I tried to order another ride and received a message that I owed $35.00 for the previous trip. I requested a review of the fare, because the morning ride is a regular ride to Dialysis, 3 days a week and $11.45 is in the normal range. I received a message today stating that the driver reported a mess made and I was provided with 2 pictures...there is no mess shown and I know a mess was not made because I didn't have anything to make a mess with.",
0,My issue with Uber is they quote you a price when you complete your trip and days later the price is different. They don't tell you anything. I started using one card just for them that is how I found out and if you check your receipt it's says wait time or toll surcharge and fees. This is robbery and they need to stop. The drivers are saying they arrive and most of the time they are in the wrong place or they drop you off in the wrong place and pretend they did not hear you say no it's over there. That's stealing.,
1,"Spent way too much time today setting up our Uber for Business account since several folks from our company are going to be traveling. Sounded like a great concept but after getting everything set up I was informed that they needed three days to process our account. Nowhere was there a mention of that and we've used Uber individually for a long time. So, tried to get some help and they just weren't too concerned or interested in trying to resolve the issue. So account is deactivated and we use another provider who seems to care a lot more about customer service. Just a warning...",
1,"Since February of 2016, I've been using Uber on behalf of the company I work for to schedule rides for our clients coming into town. I've probably spent close to $1500 in gift cards alone since then. I've never had a problem until yesterday. After two company cards, a PayPal account, and multiple attempts to pay through the app and the Mac, I could not get their system to accept a payment. I confirmed with my bank, that the issue is not the card. In fact, the bank is holding these transactions. But Uber doesn't have a record of them.",
1,My account was hacked and the hacker did rides fraud and charged 800 soles and Uber when I reported charged it too. My credit card 800 soles and after all the proof provided by me they agreed to give the money back and they mistakenly send it some unknown account not owned by me even though I reminded them my right account and now when I updated all my information they asked for dragging for 2 months and now when I was upset they decided not to return my money and block my account. Great way of robbing.,

We have messages that the payment needed changed, invalid payment method. There is no customer service # to call so I am dealing with a friggin robot. Robot says they lifted restrictions off my account. My daughter tries to use Uber again and gets a, ""Oops something went wrong!"" Only good part is I can curse out the robot and not get hung up on. Uber needs a customer service representatives, not robots to have any satisfied customers! Uber is a big joke!",
0,"I had booked a ride to take us from a restaurant on Canal Street, to the West Village. The driver stopped at the wrong place. We signaled him NOT to make a U turn on a busy street: we'd cross with the light. We did. He charged us for waiting time. Then he took the wrong route, and we wound up in New Jersey. We told him he had the wrong route, and he screamed ""I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING."" In Jersey City, there was an accident in front of us - a bad one. He swerved, and nearly started a second one. Then he told us ""as a courtesy"" he wouldn't charge the NJ surcharge. After we got back to NY (another ""courtesy"", he wouldn't charge us the toll), he started taking us to Brooklyn. Twice. Again 'I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING'. Two sixty year olds have to act like James Bond and jump out of the car when it stops, to get away. We were further downtown than when we started. Uber's reaction? ""Oh well, we refunded your fare.""",
1,"Took a Uber ride about 8 minutes. The driver was Spanish. 3 hours later get email Uber takes $80 out of my Visa card. Apparently driver says 3 hours later I did damage.

1,"They have little to no  customer service. They have no actual person that you can speak to. They make it almost impossible. I have tried to explain to them in many different ways that they have charged me double for every trip that I have taken, and charged me double the tip for every trip that I have taken, and the money has come out of my bank account, but they still keep telling me that I have an outstanding balance and That I must pay it again!",
1,"Car number plate: GFI4CZKThis may not reflect the whole of UBER, however, as my first and subsequentially last UBER ride, I think its safe to say this driver was enough to turn me against using it ever again. First, he tried to overcharge my us for our luggage (literally 4 shopping bags), despite it fitting with an excess of room, then he refused to take us when we refused to pay the overcharged amount. Rude and horrible experience which reflects poorly on the whole company. Would recommend UBER to start sufficiently interviewing their drivers so we, as customers, do not have to put up with such disgusting manners which utterly ruined my day. It may be amazing in the US but in the UK you are graced with the most shocking drivers who have no concept of customer service. If you use UBER and get this number plate, then save yourself the bother and find another car.",
0,I've driven for Uber for 3 years and constant battle for them to get fares accurate or my rides disappear completely. And it's always in their favor. And always the bigger fares. I've never been overpaid for a ride accidentally. Customer service is a joke. They act like idiots who can't understand common English and only ever send a canned response. It is the most frustrating customer services I've ever dealt with. Uber treats drivers as though they are expendable. When they list how many miles I drove on a ride it is always less than that what I actually drove according to my GPS.,
1,"Uber is continually squeezing profit away from drivers by changing their policies. I've been driving for over a year and have a nearly perfect rating. I do a fantastic job for this company and I feel completely unappreciated. I am not alone. Every month that goes by, Uber finds ways to change their policies to be less friendly to drivers, who they call partners. They have made it clear to me more than once that I am expendable. Regardless of the service that I provide for them, they are aware that hundreds of other drivers signed up today, and if I don't like it I can leave. They're changing incentives that we have counted on and taking up to two-thirds profit in many rides. Uber needs to be held accountable and must show their appreciation and value of the drivers who are the backbone of their business.",
0,"Requested an Uber from hotel on the beach to the airport, about a 45 minute drive. While I was waiting I noticed a car similar to the one I was expecting pull up and three people jumped in. Waited a little longer and then noticed that I was on my way. Someone else had taken my ride. To add insult to injury I couldn't request another Uber until that ride was done, and I got charged for it! No response as yet from Uber, I wonder how long it takes for them to respond. The driver obviously didn't verify who he picked up.",
0,"Driver took me to wrong destination - claiming I had entered the wrong address. I typed the address into the app, but it defaulted to another address (thanks, Uber). I paid about $12 extra and 15-20 extra minutes to get to the right place. I hate Uber. They just don't get it. LESSON LEARNED: When getting into the car, BE SURE TO CONFIRM your desired destination by exact street address with the driver. Uber's drivers simply follow the GPS in the app and won't ask to confirm. Uber's drivers are stupid automatons. No wonder Uber is on forefront of developing driverless technology... they are practically there already. The Uber app will offer several alternate destinations as you type in the destination address. If you, by chance, tap the wrong one - and don't notice - you'll wind up on wrong side of town. Uber accepts no responsibility. Be careful using its app. Be careful with Uber. They rip you off and you have no recourse.",
0,"As a former UberEats driver this company has HORRIBLE customer service and most of the representatives cannot comprehend English. They take you around and around asking you the same questions over and over again and they have no respect for the drivers, though they love issuing apologies without solving your issues. They have constant issues with their app and as an UberEats driver your trips REGULARLY go missing and you have to fight tooth and nail for your missing money, IF they even solve it. It sucks when your trips go missing because you then lack proof of the delivery unless you screenshot your trip (which is ridiculous to have to remember to do for every trip) which makes speaking with their unprofessional representatives even more difficult.

0,I got this guy and he charged me and never came. He blamed the GPS when I gave him clear directions then when he finally saw us he drove off and canceled the ride charging me $13 and still charged me plus a $5 fee for driving around.

1,Uber is fine unless you're trying to cancel a trip. I accidentally booked a trip. I contacted the driver and immediately within 30 seconds and he did not cancel it. I responded again 5 minutes later. The driver did not cancel. He finally told me to cancel after he arrived at my destination. The issue I have is that there's no cancellation button. I was scrolling through every area of the Uber app trying to figure out how to cancel this ride even after I contacted the driver and I could not locate anything. Upon intensive internet search trying to find an 800 number to call Uber directly and being unsuccessful I finally did an online search and was told thru a wiki article how to cancel a trip... to click on a tiny picture of the driver to access the cancel button. This is deceptive practice. I was charged $13.37 because of the driver's time because he did not cancel the ride and I had no idea or information on how to cancel it myself.,
1,I have seen the Uber commercial where they claim to do background checks for the safety of their riders. Well I had an incident in 2011 and they hired me in 2017 let me setup my life to drive and support my child and wife and out of nowhere ran a background check and closed my account and I have a 5 star rating and I just think this is unfair and they should have taking care of this before they hired me.,
1,"My husband and I went to the Taylor Swift concert in Nashville TN last night, August 25, 2018. Our Uber experiences have always been great until early this morning when trying to get back to our hotel. I don't understand how it cost roughly $26 to get from our hotel to the Nissan Stadium and $185 to get back to our hotel after the show. That is price gouging and it's illegal! We paid it to get back to our hotel because that was our only option, but that kind of money is needed for the house payment! I am extremely disappointed in Uber! I understand the demand for a ride was high, however 5.7 times higher is unacceptable!",

1,"I've decided to write a review only after a second experience of this kind. I will continue to keep close tabs on all Uber charges from now on. The fÃ¬rst time I was charged for a round trip to and from airport at the next pay level up (limo level). Uber was adamant about the charge along with the driver, despite the verifiable fact that had I actually made the trip reported, I wouldn't have landed in another city which happened to be 2 hours away by plane. This was 3 hours after I arrived at airport. The other issue verifiable by Uber's hold on my credit card for the correct amount. Price was double the authorized charge.",
0,"So I scheduled at 4:15 to 4:25am pick-up from Uber to go to airport. Uber driver notified at 3:50am and dispatched to my house. Driver leaves before my pick-up window, does not tell me he is waiting (neither does App) and I get charged a cancellation fee. I try a second time to locate a driver on Uber but none available and a driver also not available on Lyft. I end up with a taxi and a hefty fare charge. Uber touts that they offer a guarantee that your driver will be there during your pick-up time or they will give you a $10 credit. It took two e-mails to get Uber to reverse the cancellation fee, this happened only after they admitted that their driver left early. Poor, poor driver service and customer service. If Uber will not stand behind their guarantee then how can you trust them to pick you up on your scheduled time? I only ask for accountability and dependable service, isn't this what we are paying for...",

0,"The driver has submitted a claim for $150 through the app. After calling him through the Lost Item option on the app and confronting him about it, he claims he has no idea what I'm talking about and that he's ""too busy"" for this. His claims are false and fraudulent, and I will NOT be held liable for a fraudulent scam. I will be reporting this company and your driver to the police for fraud. I will also report you to the Better Business Bureau and raise hell on any and every social media site known to mankind.",
1,"Whenever I book a bike or cab from Uber they never came in location from which I have booked the cab. They always go somewhere else, the problem with uber is picking up the location. Its app picks up the wrong location and the drivers goes somewhere else, then I need to help drivers to get my location. So here is the incident: yesterday (10 Aug 2018) I booked a Uber bike and I put my drop location, the same location I always puts whether it's uber or Ola and before reaching the exact location the driver says, ""This is the location you have put and I will not go beyond this location,"" I told him that, ""You will need to go from another side. This street is closed to get my place,"" he denied to go. I told him, ""If you drop me on my location then you will be paid otherwise no payment.""",
0,"I tried to schedule a trip for Sunday.  When I went into the app to schedule a ride, it immediately dispatched a driver.  I pressed cancel on the app several times with no results.  I then saw who the driver was and called her.  She thanked me and didn't come.  5 minutes later, another Uber driver came.  He cancelled the trip after hearing my issue asking that the customer not be charged.  Two minutes later another driver came.  I then was charged a cancellation fee.",
0,Tried driving for them going on two weeks still waiting on the decal I ordered twice.  By time it comes I won't be trying to drive for them.  Guess it's better then a two week wait from lyft on a background check. Not worth it. Y time you get everything it's the same as waiting 2-3 weeks at a new job for a paycheck.,
0,I ordered an Uber and the driver picked up the wrong riders. I contacted Uber and received a notification that I would receive a refund and they never gave me my refund and no one has gotten back to me no matter how many times I have contacted them. They acknowledged that someone else took my ride but still didn't refund the money. Horrible customer service. Or lack there of.,
0,"I'm really disappointed with Uber for what I feel was â€œpointing of a gun at my face and rip me offâ€ at the very last minute when I needed the service the most. I had book a trip from Madrid to the Airport, I was showed a fare from low to high, I was ok with it, I ordered the service. Less than 10 minutes before my trip, I received a message from Uber saying that due to congestion and demand (6AM and Madrid was empty), I will be charge 50% or more. I received this message and at the same time the confirmation that the driver was on its way.",
0,"Beware. This company allows drivers to submit fake pictures claiming you made a mess of their cars and will charge you up to $150 extra without even giving you the common decency of a phone call. I was hit with a totally false charge and Uber initially refused to refund me. I did absolutely nothing to the driver or his vehicle yet when this claim hit my email, because Uber does absolutely nothing over the phone, they had already charged me without hearing my side for any details. Please avoid this alleged criminally designed company. They are not worth the headache and definitely not worth your hard earned money.",
0,I have never experienced a worse service experience than I have had with UBER both here in the US and on my recent trip to the UK. I don't understand how a company can be allowed to do business when it treats their customers the way I was treated. I got a promotional code from Citibank AAdvantage credit card services to use a promo code so I can get credit on my first 2 rides with Uber. I had never used Uber before so I downloaded the App and proceeded to put in the promo code. I kept on getting error messages so I tried to get a customer service phone number in the US. To my surprise a company as big as Uber does not offer any phone customer service in the US. A multibillion dollar company with NO PHONE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!,
1,It's been 6 months for today. I had recharged for 1000 on Jan 31st 2018. I see that in my payment there is a balance of only 650 Rs. When I started querying Uber on my 350 Rs till date these shameless guys haven't turned up to me with a valid justification as in where that money went.,
1,"I do really appreciate the value of the Uber Pool. You can't beat the cost. Drivers are typically very friendly, but the GPS they use is terrible. I usually have to direct them because the GPS is so lacking.",
1,Uber is helpful to get around as we do not live near a city bus. We can open the app and see how long a ride will take. This helps the teens and seniors in our family when I am at work. It is competitive and cheaper than a taxi.,
1,"I had left my phone in an Uber car whilst away on business in San Jose in April, I am yet to have a satisfactory conclusion to my dispute. I went to my hotel room and got my tablet device and went to the Uber website and logged in however, couldn't do anything without an SMS verification which would be sent to my phone which was in the car, so pointless. I downloaded the Uber app on device but couldn't operate anything there. I even logged onto Samsung website and attempted to force my phone to ring but it was out of power. The only way I could get hold of Uber was by writing on Twitter at how bad my experience was and they asked me to private message. I then explained where I went from and to and the times and took a snapshot of the email receipt for the trip. ",
1,"I was very happy with Uber until my last experience when I had a ride with Uber to Kashmiri gate. When I booked the ride I was shown 188/- for my ride. As soon as driver arrived he said it is 285/- fare showing on his app. I thought it will be updated. At the end of the ride driver asked me to pay the amount showing on his app. I showed him it is 188 on my end. He said, â€œYou can escalate it later with Uber. Right now you will have to pay 285/â€. I paid it, also the receipt I got from Uber is still showing 188.",
0,I love using Uber. Sometimes the price is higher than the cab service and that sucks. If they were a bit cheaper I would use Uber all the time!,
1,"I've use Uber for the last 2 years and never complained about anything even when I had small issues. Today I've tried to talk to a human being for the last 4 hours and there is NONE existence!! The automated stupid robot keeps emailing be nonsense - I asked for A ride at 4:30 am and it said driver is 9 min away for $35 rate - after 30 minutes I saw on the app that the driver is struggling to find the place - I called, texted and no response. Finally he canceled. Second driver showed 7 min away with the same rate. The same exact thing except this one the driver at least called. Trust me I don't live in a desert. I've had many rides on the same location.",
0,Both drivers were early and courteous. They were both efficient drivers and got us to our destination on time. The only objection was their route of travel. Since it was our first experience we did not know we could have told them there was a faster more direct route to our destination.,
0,Used Uber when we were attending a wedding in CA and they were prompt and the driver was good. Driving on CA highways can be stressful but the driver knew where he was going.,
0,"I ordered an Uber around 1130pm on July 20, 2018 for a 4.6 mile drive that would normally take 10 minutes. The regular car said it would cost almost $17 and the rideshare option was between $11-12. I opted for the cheaper option to save some money. The app told me the driver would arrive in 5 minutes, I waited in excess of that for the driver, fine. I get in the vehicle and settle in to look at my phone to see the fare jumped to $14.06. I agreed to one fare and Uber charged me over the agreed upon fare. Not to mention the driver drove so slow as if he was waiting for another pickup along route. I arrived to my destination much later than expected. He would stop at stop signs and wait half a minute before moving, it was past midnight at this point and there was nobody on the road. He also drove a route that was slightly longer than another.",
0,The only problem I ever had was at Las Vegas airport at passenger pick up. I had to wait almost an hour and had to cancel twice before a driver actually showed they were going to airport. All other places were good.,
1,"Was a little nervous to use but after I did, I found that I felt very safe each time, very polite drivers, clean cars and felt very comfortable. I was impressed.",
1,"I've only used Uber once but I had a good experience. They arrived on time, took the shortest route and got me to my destination. He was very pleasant and friendly.",
1,"The service is great! I trust my children riding with Uber. And the benefit to the community is not measurable, I'm confident the service has saved many accidents and damages to persons and property.",
0,"I like Uber for the most part. Their prices fluctuate (increase) frequently. There is no phone number or email to get in touch with Corporate. You get charged when the drivers go to the wrong place and say you aren't there. You get charged when you cancel but you don't get anything when drivers don't show and there is no way to make this known. For the most part it is ok but, these are things that have happened to me or family or people I know.",
1,"Uber is easier to use than a taxi. Instead of trying to find a cab, I just ordered a Uber from my phone and the driver found me. The car was clean and the driver was courteous.",
0,I am very impressed with the overall concept of the Uber and the dependability of service. Drivers are personable but not overbearing, courteous and intuitive - every customer does not always want to interact or converse.
1,"I have used Uber since they came to my area. The prices have skyrocketed since they first began service here. The last two times I used it, the driver was lost and driving around forever so the wait was extremely long. Besides the price hikes, I really like Uber.",
1,"Contacted Uber via Phone app for services from address used on multiple occasions. Uber provided four locations for me to travel to be picked up for my ride! Aren't they supposed to pick me up from my location? I ran with arms full of packages to four different locations. The driver was most likely unfamiliar with area, thus the reason for the many changes. I couldn't keep up with the driver's request for different locations via foot. I finally sent a text to the driver for clarification.",
1,Uber has really been difficult. I would like to use my account to order food but the number associated with my account is almost 5 years old. I haven't had that number in AT LEAST 3 years but they will not allow me to change it because according to support the only way to change it is through the app. So I download the app and enter my number but obviously that doesn't work cause it's not associated with my email. It is however associated with the driver account I attempted to make but there was no email associated with that account because the process was not finished.,
0,"The vehicles were all clean over our recent trip to Washington DC. The drivers were all kind and friendly... Overall, it was a much nicer experience than the cab rides.",
0,"I have used several ride share companies and believe it's the best idea for travel, whether short or long distances. The drivers were always on time for pickup and drop-off to all destinations, were always polite, informative, and cordial but most importantly, I always felt safe because they were registered with a business who does background checks, would provide photos of the car and driver, accepted all forms of payment, conveniently provide their app on smart phones, and rating scale for satisfaction.",
0,I used Uber when I had no ride to my post op visit and couldn't drive yet. It was a lifesaver! I got to my appointment in time and caught another driver back. It seemed a lot to spend $50 round trip but also a necessity when I couldn't drive.,
0,"Uber is not only an excellent service, it has been for me one of the most important service I can't live without it, practical and all my experiences up to today very good, with very kind and respectful drivers.",
0,Usually excellent. The one time I had a driver who went 2 hours out of the way (while I fell asleep) the charge was enormous. Uber credited me back within 2 days.,
0,"I usually have good experiences with Uber. Drivers are pleasant and cars are clean and on time. My only complaint is the extremely high rates at peak times. I had one trip where it was $60 to the event and $315 to return home. Obviously, I had to find another way to get home.",
0,I used Uber for travel to and from airports. It is a great way to get to my planes or final destination that is often a good distance from the airports.,
1,I have only used this occasionally in a few cities and each time the experience was well worth it. The description of the car and the estimate of cost were both great. The cars were clean and modern and the driver was courteous.,
1,"I've been using Uber for years to take trips home from the store. It's a really convenient app for me, especially because I don't have a car. The drivers are almost always nice. I think it's been so rare for me to have a bad experience with someone. Also, probably the one feature I have not been a fan of us is seeing my customer rating, gives me a bit of anxiety. Overall it's a good service. I've almost never had to wait more than 10 minutes too. The prices have gone up but I am thinking (and hoping) this is because they will pay drivers better.",
1,The drivers were fine. The problem was I could not speak to a live person. It was very frustrating not to be able to talk to a person. On occasion it took me over 2 hrs to book a ride. Their system went haywire.,
1,It is a good service but the website or app has very little on questions from users. It is very difficult to see if the service is good or not through the website. You need to try it first and the service keeps on changing without notice. Which in some ways is great but no upfront info or call in to talk to.,
0,"Uber works. I have used it in several places around the world. It is usually cheap, convenient and hassle-free. However, surge pricing can get out of hand. Also, I'm not convinced that they treat their drivers fairly.",
0,Car was dirty inside and the air conditioning did not work. The price was fine but I expected a much more desirable vehicle. I am glad there wasn't some with me because the back seat was full of clothes and sports gear.,
1,"I was planning on taking an Uber to Midway airport on my recent trip to Chicago. I was planning on leaving at noon. I checked what it would cost me around 11:30. I was quoted $35. 20 min later when I got down to the lobby and ordered my Uber, the price jumped to $58! I switched to Lyft which was only minimally cheaper. Next time I will leave myself more time and take the train! Very disappointed because I really enjoyed taking Uber from the airport. Never again! Taxis are cheaper!",
0,I have used it regularly especially in Europe. Found it to be quick and efficient at a fair price. Have only had one issue where language was a major issue and we were put out a mile from our destination.,
1,"Not a regular user of Uber but the five times. Uber it was convenient, safe, and reasonable priced. Much less than a DUI and paying for airport parking.",
1,"I gave a tip to a driver and he was almost very thankful, told me it is rare to get a tip because Uber does not encourage it. Most everyone should be encourage to tip if the service is provided.",
1,The first time they left me because I wasn't outside fast enough and when I did the app again that morning the price had gone up. Time was of the essence because I needed to get to the airport. I then took a shared ride. That's when I learned what that means and everyone wasn't going to the airport.,
1,The Uber app has the help option but only accommodates a number of preset problem configurations and absolutely nothing outside of it. I had an issue where I was grossly overcharged for a ride. Now there was construction in the area but the driver admitted that he was completely unfamiliar with the area and therefore his lack of knowledge was the more significant reason for my delay.,
0,"Ease of use is great, being able to not have money change hands and can tip online is a huge plus. The cars are clean and the drivers are respectful. Never have had to wait more than ten minutes.",
1,Needed to use it to go to a running store for a Packet Pickup... driver very courteous and good driver on the freeways and to find the place. It only took a couple minutes to get my packet and he agreed to stay and return me to my hotel where I got the pickup from. I was pleased with the service he provided and gave him a nice tip. There was no other potential way for me to get to the Packet Pickup unless I used a taxi and I'm positive that would have cost quite a bit more. Place was about 30 minutes away.,
0,"Convenience, on-time performance, easy to hail a ride, competitive pricing with a regular taxicab. Helpful drivers too. App also makes it super easy to find a ride in minutes.",
1,"I buy gift cards for my son and he uses them quite often. I have had problems a couple times, but it is usually on my end. But when I call for help, they are great. They handle it very quickly. He has only had problems with a couple drivers, but other than that both of us are very happy with the service.",
0,"Uber was a life saver when we needed it. The drivers were all wonderful courteous people but the company was not so great. There is no way to get help or even talk to someone from the company and the app was difficult to navigate. There were added fees like Uber technology fee that were not explained or mentioned that was just taken out of our account. There wasn't even a way to ask about it and the drivers got none of the extra money!! Lastly, I kept getting strange texts for Uber codes after I began the process of trying to be a driver. I changed my mind when I found out someone was already trying to hack my account and rack up an unknown amount of charges on it. I will not use Uber again unless it is like the last time I had to do it an emergency with no other options.",
1,"The first (and last) time I ever used Uber, the fare estimate was $61. When I logged on to book a car, I got a screen that looked like upgrade options, the lowest of which was $89. There was an option to ""Skip this Step"" so I did. I never got a screen telling me my total or asking me if I agreed to book it or not. Just that the car was on its way. The car that arrived was a huge SUV that could probably seat at least 8 people (I was alone and had one small piece of luggage and a backpack), and when I looked at the receipt later, I saw that they charged me $150 for this unnecessarily huge vehicle. When I wrote them about it they claimed I submitted a different destination location, which is entirely untrue. And they were so cold as to not even give me a break as a 1st time user, refunding at least some of that outrageous total. Terrible company in my experience.",
1,I requested a ride from Times Square to the Statue of Liberty. The rate was $26 and supposed to take 20 mins. There was a lot of traffic so I didn't think much of the long ride until I started to notice all the cars had New Jersey plates. We were in Hoboken because our driver had obviously taken a wrong turn somewhere. To make matters worse he spoke little English so he could not explain what was going on. At one point he turned onto an entrance ramp in error and tried backing up it. When that didn't work he turned around and drove the wrong way. When we finally got to the New Jersey side of the ferry I received the final fare from Uber at $77! When I filed a complaint they said I had input the wrong address so it's my fault we ended up in New Jersey and refused to refund me the fare. Numerous emails back and forth got me nowhere so I am left having to dispute the charge with my credit card. Stay away from this scam artist company.,
0,All the convenience of a taxi at half the price. They are there in minutes rather than the unknown taxi ETA. They are always friendly. The cars are usually clean and smell good. I don't ever use taxis anymore. You can schedule a day and time to be picked up too. And that's very nice.,
0,I have only had one ride experience I wish not to repeat - I love the ease of getting a ride and the efficiency of the drivers. The costs are always reasonable as well. I will definitely use Uber in my future.,
0,Both of my Uber drivers were prompt. The conversation was great! They made my ride very pleasant and enjoyable. Also my car was down at the time and they were a big help!,
0,"They found me just fine. Only had one time where they couldn't find me, but someone else found me. And I got home just fine. And he waited until I got inside. He made me feel very comfortable.",
1,"The driver ""cancelled"" and they charge me a cancellation free!! - I use the App for an Uber to pick me up from a gated community. The application directs me to a pickup intersection about 1/4 mile from my current location (on a very hot muggy night). I arrive there but me driver. After a 10 minute wait, I get a ""ride cancelled"" message from the App. At the time of the message notification, I see the driver on the App about a mile away at one of the entrances.",
1,The driver that picked me up was not the driver listed on the app which means there is no security. The driver had lended his car to another to use his Uber. I also brought home bedbugs from the filthy cab. Very dangerous for woman and older individuals...,
0,"The app and the information it provides are invaluable. I know how much my fare will be, who is picking me up, where they are and the actual route they are taking me. What's not to love?",
1,My main complaint would be the fact that each ride are different and prices at different times. Meaning I can go to Walmart today at 5 p.m. from home and it can cost for example $7 then I can go to the exact same Walmart from home on a different date and that ride will cost $13. Or I'll take a ride from home to Walmart and it cost $7 then when I go to get a ride from Walmart to home the ride will cost $13. No. I don't understand how the prices can fluctuate so much.,
1,They charge me $35:00 for an eight-mile trip. When the request was made it was eight dollars. When the driver showed the final figure it was seventeen. When I saw the final charges it was 35:00. Uber is horrible in my opinion.,
1,"I thought that some of my trips were overpriced due to the fact that I was going such a short distance, but understand that this is how the driver gets paid! But the surge pricing was outrageous and would always wait a few extra minutes for it to lower as I wasn't about to pay sometimes 15.00 or more for a mile and a half ride!",
1,"In Las Vegas airport Uber pickup area... The Uber guy told me he was my ride but that was not true. He had another person he was picking up, when they arrived they were too big for us all to be in car. So he made me take my luggage from his trunk and call another Uber. He was Never my driver but I didn't know that. (They all looked alike.) I wish I had his name.",
1,I have had at least 2 drivers come on to me in a sexual manner. Another kept calling me at home to go out with him. Don't know how he got my number. Will never use Uber again. Only Lyft.,
0,Every time I have used this service I have had a great experience. I have met wonderful drivers who are always friendly and polite. Rates are far better than taxis and much more convenient.,
1,We used Uber to and from the airport in Philadelphia in December. It was quick and convenient. But this is my only experience with them. I went with my boyfriend. I'm not sure if I'd feel as secure if I'd been alone. I don't feel like they do a thorough background check on drivers. I've heard too many stories where the passenger is harassed or hurt.,
0,A very convenient service. The cab industry got out-maneuvered. They could have/should have started the same type of service using their cabbies. Uber is also relatively inexpensive to use.,
0,"I get severe, sudden onset migraines. Sometimes I have to go to the emergency room and there is no one home to drive me there and home again. The Uber drivers have always been very polite, kind, and careful. I have never had any qualms about getting into the car.",
1,"I travelled with Uber driver Girish on 15th July 2018 in Pune, from Karvenagar to Pune airport. After the trip was completed, the driver asked for amount Rs. 340, and he did not mention anything about charging from my linked credit card. I paid the entire amount of Rs 340 to the driver in cash. NOW UBER IS CHARGING ME SECOND TIME FOR THE SAME TRIP, HORRIBLE CHEATING which is illegal, unethical, immoral and totally unjustified! They have refused to even talk with the concerned driver, and are constantly harassing me to pay the double amount for absolutely no reason.",
0,I have had four very good Uber rides. The website is easy to use and a driver usually shows up pretty quickly. I had to wait once because there was no available drivers but the wait wasn't long. So far so good.,
0,"Uber is easy, less expensive and they don't stink. Always on time, never sultry or obnoxious. Taxis are obsolete and the only time I would take a taxi is if I could not find an Uber ride.",
0,"The service was great, the driver was appropriately friendly, cost was good too. The car was clean as well. I appreciated the service. I have recommended the service and would use again myself.",
0,"Uber is fast and easy! There is nothing like it and now we can't live without it! Uber will be here forever! Uber can take you to and from the airport, take you to and from the grocery store, to and from night spots, to and from sporting events, to and from funerals, to and from wedding receptions, to and from the baby showers, to and from Christmas parties, pool parties, New Year's Eve parties, office parties, On and on and on! We love Uber ask a mission point.",
0,Am so grateful to have Uber. But wish they had a phone number. The drivers have been great. Cars have been clean and comfortable. I don't drive and will use Uber fairly often.,
0,"Overall my experience with Uber is wonderful with the exception of my 1st attempt, while I was trying to figure out the app, and got charged for a trip I cancelled within 3 MIN!",
0,"Although it may be a perception it seems safer. Most of the drivers I have met seem like nice likable people. Cars are much cleaner, not like cabs in Chicago.",
0,I have had very successfully rides with Uber. Very dependable and safe drivers. Downloaded app is very easy to use. Responsibly priced and would definitely use them again.,
1,"For the most part I find the drivers to be friendly, professional and careful. Also, they arrive promptly. However, occasionally a driver speaks about political views which is inappropriate conversation. I experienced this in London but the local drivers haven't discussed touchy topics.",
0,Awesome for going out with friends and no one wants to drive because we're drinking. Show you the driver's face and make of the car so you know exactly who's picking you up.,
0,"The driver was very knowledgeable about the area, great conversation. The car was clean and had a nice scent. He was on time, opened the door and even offered mints.",
1,Used Uber on a family vacation in Boston and got great service from where we dropped off our rental car to the north end where having to drive is totally crazy. Driver really knew his way around. I use to live there so I knew he was not going off the beaten path.,
0,"Had problems with Uber app. Driver was great, friendly, courteous and on time, he but had the wrong directions. I wonder if I was overcharged. Have no idea how much I was charged.",
0,"I like the service. In the app you can track the cab, the driver's picture as well as the make/model of the car. Before you enter you're given a short description about the driver. And at the end of the ride you have the option of rating the driver. Definitely would recommend Uber!",
0,"I've used Uber in several cities New York, Chicago, Orlando, Miami, Boston, Las Vegas. I feel safer when I can see a picture and car description in a society where it is so unsafe for women traveling alone. In Vegas it was the cheapest way to get to and from the airport. Boston didn't allow airport pickup but I got one to return to airport, a savings of $20. If the cabs want to compete they need to adjust their rates and make us feel safer.",
0,"Very useful, took several short trips, drivers very willing to help, tracking info on smartphone really great, drivers offered to charge my phone, give directions too.",
0,"I've had 90% great rides. The other 10% were either rude or acted like you were bothering them asking for a ride. I've had the worse experiences with Middle Eastern men who don't seem to like women questioning/telling them anything. But, to each their own.",
0,"While I have encountered a few minor issues, they were indeed minor. I love the ease in calling for a ride, my options in selecting the kind of ride I want [when I do grocery shopping I ride alone so I have room for my groceries & get right home]. Paying & tipping is easy. Every driver has been great; their cars are always clean & modern [never a beater]. Always smoke-free.",
0,I have been a devoted customer in Canada and the US. I have had continual operational issues in Calgary. My house in downtown Calgary doesn't even work on their maps. New drivers get lost 75 percent of the time to the international airport. The biggest complaint I have is today I waited about an hour to receive a ride 4 km away from my house. l should have walked. Through their incredible incompetence they charged me a cancellation fee as I'm standing directly under the address sign for over 30 minutes. I just hope people stop using an unsafe and unreliable mode of travel in the future.,
0,"Rudest, most ignorant and have had 3 or 4 that drive past & LEAVE you stranded particularly IF it IS A RIDE SHARE. THOSE ARE the most economical however some drivers don't want to take them.",
0,Fast and low cost service. Used five times so far and always reliable. Sure beats taxis. Drivers were very professional and easy to work with. Paying for the ride with my credit card and the map showing where my driver is relative to picking me up are nice features.,
0,"We have used this service frequently in several cities. So far it has largely been very positive. Most cars, prompt, clean, safe and the drivers courteous. No major complaints. The timing is sometimes off...they come too quickly and are impatient or are slightly late. For the most part, it is good to excellent. Keep the prices down to have an edge over other taxi services.",
1,"If there is an issue there is no way to contact anyone except by email. A driver in Tanpa had a car that should have not been approved, did not assist with bags. The day after my flight home, he put in a ticket for a ride which of course was a know-how for which I was billed. I had to email ISO of speaking to someone to resolve this which they did.",
0,"My grandson who is 19, took care of the computer/iPad stuff in Texas, smooth as clockwork, priced very fair. Both from Houston to Dallas and round trip.",
0,I needed a medical transportation vehicle. They were the cheapest by far and they were trained professionals. The cost was approximately 10% of what transport services was charging.,
0,I have always had a good experience with Uber. There was only one time when the driver drove way too fast. It seems as if he was annoyed to have to do this fair so early in the morning. But otherwise... Uber is great!,
1,I love the app. Uber is a great way for getting around and it's still somewhat economical. Great in Dallas but not so good in Tucson where I was not able to get an Uber early morning pick up to the airport.,
0,"The driver I had was professional, friendly, and personable. He made sure we were safe in his car, got to our destination safely. I would definitely use this car service again.",
0,"Our drivers, two different ones, were very polite, helpful and interesting. Now I love Uber! We had quite a bit of luggage and three people. Loaded everything in comfortably.",
0,Baltimore drivers are not as courteous as Dallas drivers but overall pretty good! About 3-5 months ago it was a problem that my drivers would not show in the early morning hours in Charleston SC that need to be addressed/tweeted, also asking for a tip is not proper etiquette if you're good then it's no need to ask but if you do not acknowledge me as a person I will not tip!
1,"As a disabled person, when in SF, Uber and Lyft are often the only choice I have. I prefer to call or hail a taxi, but that's not always possible. However, Uber's existence has caused a marked increase in traffic, making it harder to get around and customer service is non-existent.",
0,"I had no problem with my Uber experience except the car was very strong smoke smell. Must of been in seats because my clothes smelled like stale cigarette smoke. It was a very nice car, clean, driver was a very polite/courtesy young man. I use Uber and will continue. Everyone has been great.",
0,"The driver didn't speak when I got in the car, he was very disrespectful. I went out one night and had on one of my good outfits and when he saw me he said something smart about what I had on.",
0,"Whether I am using Uber for a ride service or Uber Eats ordering food the service has been terrible. Out of the 10 times ordering food from Uber Eats 9 times food has been forgotten. Every time I have requested a refund for the missing item until recently they told me to refrain from this type of behaviour and told me they would be restricting my account. Not sure why I should be punished for their drivers not checking the food prior to delivery. Recently while traveling I ordered an Uber to the place I was staying, I notified the driver it was a tricky place to find and even provided extremely specific instructions. I attempted to contact the driver numerous times but had no response. The driver cancelled the trip and I was charged a cancellation fee. I guess moral of the story is this company makes the consumer pay for their employees mistakes. Please refrain from using this service if possible, I know I'll be finding alternatives.",
0,Uber is a big fraud.. They charged me with double money.. My money was cut from pytm also  and my driver also asked for the money.. For the same there was no positive response from the uber customer care ...dont try it... It is a big cheater..,
0,"I was in South Beach, FL. I was staying at a major hotel and ordered an Uber. The driver could not find me which was ridiculous. I was waiting out front of the hotel which was located on the main drag of SOBE. He hung up on me and charged me $5. I disputed the charge so now I have a credit on my account. Uber isn't available where I live. The last time I ordered a car in South Beach the driver hardly spoke English and couldn't find TJ MAXX. My advice... don't use Uber in Florida.",
0,I had damage to my vehicle due to a Uber driver my upstairs neighbor used. The trim from the rear wheel well was broke off. The driver didn't leave a note. He kept calling my neighbor. Now he will not answer his phone. Can't get a number for Uber to locate the driver.,
0,"I use Uber fairly frequently. Overall it has been a good service. I've had amazing drivers. You cannot call them. Only go through some steps to send them messages. I want to just call them if I have an issue. It's so frustrating. However, two things have happened in a short time that will make me be very wary in using Uber in the future. Might just go back to taking cabs.",
0,"Last night I returned home from the airport using Uber. Shared a ride. The other person paid $36.97 vs my $58.42. First stop was their residence (farther away from the airport than my place). Needless to say, I was not happy when I heard that my fare was 58 percent more. Uber says it's ""dynamic pricing"" and will not issue me a partial refund. And... with the company burning through its cash at over $1 billion a year and turmoil in the executive ranks, one would think the company might be more sensitive to such inequalities.",
1,My last 2 experiences with Uber have made me use taxis which turned out to be preferable to Uber. Two weeks ago called for an Uber and my driver did not speak or understand English so I immediately got out and was still charged on Tuesday. October 24th I requested an Uber to take me to midway airport. When I received notification that my driver had arrived--I called since I was already waiting outside. He informed me that he was in Lombard. And here I was at the place I am always picked up in Chicago. Guess I am on to Lyft.,
1,"Our party of 6 consisted of three of my adult daughters and two friends going wedding dress shopping. We needed an SUV to accommodate all of us, and Uber showed a driver 20 minutes away in Sanford, Florida. Perfect, we thought as the reservation wasn't for another 40 minutes. We waited, and waited but the map showed the driver staying at the same place originally shown, yet the eta remained the same. We thought that the map must be frozen, so a reset was done, and then it showed that the driver had picked us up and was on route to someplace other than where we were going AND WITHOUT US! To make matters worse, our credit card was charged and we were very late for our appointment. There must be a way for Uber to assure that your card is being used for YOUR trip and not for someone else.",
0,"75% of the time I'm extremely satisfied, but here are my pet gripes: 1) No flat rate from airport, as there are with taxis and limos. From JFK we got stuck at the midtown tunnel and my fare (time + distance) was almost twice the flat taxi fare. 2) The driver's profile does not indicate if they have a FasTrak transponder. Coming from LAX to DTLA on two occasions we were stuck in traffic on the I-110 because the driver didn't have FasTrak and so we couldn't use the express lanes. When a driver accepts the request, if the snapshot description (name, make of car, license #, etc) also had ""Can use FasTrak express lanes - Yes/No"" I would know to reject a pickup from a driver if they lack FasTrak. Another solution would be to have an option in my profile's preferences, to only accept drivers who have FasTrak.",
1,"I had driven to KCVG to leave a rental car. Having used Uber oh let say a half dozen time in my life. I charge up my phone that had gone dead. Now at the Avis rental car return the system informed me to drive over to the terminal. This is after the Avis agent informs me ""Oh yes. Uber picks up here."" I follow the instructions Uber gave. I take the shuttle to terminal and do not summon ride until at pickup site. Here is the hurtful thing... Now I could be wrong. While I am looking at the drive from Lyft I get this call from the Uber driver... ""I am outside..."" the way the exchange starts.",
0,"I used many times UBER rides in USA. I Visited Delhi India two weeks ago and had selected my card as the payment method but when I reached my destination the driver requested a cash payment. I thought maybe my credit card was not working here so I paid him cash, later I found out my credit card was also charged. When I requested the refund from Uber they give me excuses by automated reply like it's my fault I would have not given cash to Driver. What I supposed to do when driver is insisting to pay cash after completion of ride. At that time there was no way so I could confirm from UBER office before paying. Uber sent automated emails saying wouldn't have a refund option for this exact issue. SO NO MORE UBER.",
1,"My last two experiences with Uber were not too great. The car that picked me up was old, dirty and nasty with dog hair everywhere and the air conditioner didn't work. It was 90+ degrees out and we had to ride with the windows down. The experience was a ride to the airport and that was frantic. The man had only been in my town for a few weeks and he was confused on how to get to the airport. I don't think Uber is checking on who's driving and in what vehicles.",
1,"Uber is frud , uber driver charged double amount from me on 20/10/2017. I was traveling from Thane to vikroli. I checked amount was Rs 176. After dropping me he charged Rs. 470. About this problem I discussed through sms but no positive response from customer care. They are not even return my money. Driver create show on the road so I paid money. But customer care people are also frud people. They don't want to resolve the Issue
My suggestion is don't go With uber. They don't even have contact number. They are cheaper and cheater",
1,"It's unfortunate to know that Uber allows its drivers to rate clients. My rating with Uber was 4.86 and after a recent trip out of town and used Uber my rating dropped to 4.63. I was kind and friendly to the driver. I engaged in the conversation that he started, I also sent him an additional tip post my trip. I will no longer ride with Uber and leave a driver who may be unhappy in his or her job or having a bad day or expecting a cash tip to rate me as a client and passenger. I treat all people with kindness and respect and my driver ratings have always been very good to excellent. You have lost a loyal customer.",
0,"DO NOT ACCEPT RIDE WITH UBER DRIVER ""EDGAR"" IN SILVER TOYOTA SIENNA VAN!!! Me, my husband, and six year old daughter requested an Uber to take us back to the Sanford International Airport Wednesday, October 25th from Disney's Art of Animation Resort. We had a great experience with our trip to the resort the Wednesday prior with Mike who drove a grey Lexus. That fare totaled $40.49 and we tipped him $10. That said, we requested another Uber X for our trip returning to the Sanford airport with the same expected $40 fare - this was the fare provided when we accepted ride.",
1,"I received e-mails from Uber asking me why I do not take Uber anymore. There is no way to reply to - they only SEND emails, they DO NOT ACCEPT e-mails.1. AUTOMATED customer service is the biggest problem of Uber. That is the first reason for which I stopped taking Uber. I tried to call Uber when in need. I found with difficulty a number on the web. I called it and a stupid message said: ""Don't bother leaving a message, there are 20,000 messages in this mailbox"". Whoever left that message was a major $#*!, Probably Travis Kalanick or one of those cocky bastards that Uber has plenty of.2. Uber VERY POOR customer service has cost me $ 650. In May 2016 I forgot my new iPhone ($650) in the Uber and there was NO WAY to retrieve it - there is NO Uber phone customer service where one can talk to a live person and explain the problem.That's a big flaw. I called Uber automated customer service from a hotel and never received an answer. I e-mailed multiple times, I left feedback over the Uber website. I received a response only TWO DAYS afterwards. Of course, TWO DAYS afterwards my iPhone was long gone. That is why Uber poor customer service has cost me $ 650. Uber has not offered me any compensation for that - and THE SAME THING can happen again. 3. The cars are often dirty. I initially switched from taxis to Uber because I cannot stand taxis that are dirty and smell of food because the driver eats in there. However over time the Uber has started being just as bad. There is no quality control of car. I have had dirty Uber cars, or banged up Uber cars or drivers that couldn't follow a GPS and took much longer than they should have. The dirtiness is by far the biggest problems.
In contrast, Lyft has CLEAN cars. It enforces cleanliness.4. I do not care about the negative press that Uber has had. However, I do care very much about:
- the car being CLEAN, with NO FOOD SMELL
- the driver that knows how to drive and follow a GPS.
- your having an ACTUAL customer service. It is impossible to e-mail Uer - though uber DOES send email to you. Until Uber solves these problems, I will no longer take Uber cars. I will go to Lyft and other competitors, every time.",
1,This guy is the worst Uber driver I have ever met he doesn't even show up when asked to be picked up do not let him drive you anywhere,
0,"Alexandria, VA - October 6, 2017: I was charged a ""waiting fee"", even though I was standing precisely at the GPS location from which I requested the ride, in front of my home, when the Uber driver pulled up. The Uber driver did not have to wait even one minute. In fact, it was I who waited for the Uber driver to show up. Manhattan, NY - October 6, 2017: I was charged a ""waiting fee"", even though I was standing precisely at the GPS location from which I requested the ride and at which the Uber driver picked me up. The Uber driver did not have to wait even one minute. In fact, it was I who waited for the Uber driver to show up.",
0,"On Oct. 8, 2017 at 1:12:45 PM - There should be No charge for this ride. Despite using a GPS, this driver tried to take a closed entrance to the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel and then had to detour back to the original entrance Once in Manhattan. And 10 blocks from our theater destination he took another wrong turn and ended up in New Jersey. By the time he got back to Manhattan it was already past the starting time of the play we were going to. As a matter of fact it was already 30 minutes into the play.",
1,"I requested a ride from my residence to Publix grocery store, $8.48 and $5 tip. When finished shopping, I found my phone was not in my pocket. Upon exiting, the driver was outside with my phone. I had dropped it in her car and she returned it. I was very grateful. Return home was $7.15 and $5 tip (a different driver). Checked my bank account when I got home, was charged total of $48.84. Registered concern in the app. There is no customer service phone number. I was sent a message that I was charged $15 for returning my phone. Still a discrepancy. I replied and my concerned was totally dismissed. Message said complaint was resolved. Terrible service. No more Uber for me.",
0,"I had selected my card as the payment method but when I reached my destination the driver requested a cash payment and I obliged since Uber has a refund option for such circumstances but when I requested the refund they give me excuses like it's my fault for not checking the payment method, etc. If that was the case, they wouldn't have a refund option for this exact issue. This is the second time Uber has done this to me and it is the only reason why I'm lodging a complaint here.",
0,"This is a complaint about a trip on 28.9.17 ordered at 8.25 a.m. Eastern time in Boston. The expected arrival time delayed a lot, 3 min, 6 min, 9 min, 4 min and so on. Then after approx 12 minutes a message came that Driver ** has cancelled the trip! For reference: the surcharge when booing was factor 1.4. Then my host Jennifer booked for me, meanwhile the surcharge was 2.4. I finally arrived with much delay at the railway station. The driver just cancelled since he expected more profitable trips to perform during that time. This practice was confirmed by another Uber driver in Boston when I openly talked with him. On top of all they charged me 5 USD for cancellation. I did not cancel. Finally Uber paid me back only the 5 USD cancellation fee, they did not refund me the approx 15 USD loss being the difference between factor 1.4 and 2.4.",
1,"Uber drivers in Sydney (and other cities around the world ) have a bad habit of accepting jobs from miles away and sometimes up to 20mins, while still dropping off a passenger and while there are dozens of cars very close to the new job location. I had one this morning again to take me from home in Rushcutters Bay to work in the city and there were at least 6 cars within 1-2mins from my location. This the ** Uber driver, still took the job while still in the city some 15mins away. Uber needs to do something about this sort of behaviour as it ruins the customer experience and make people angry, if customers want ** service they would take a cab. The solution could be very simple, offer a function on the app for the users to manage a circular area around the pickup zone beyond which Uber drivers are excluded from picking up rides. Simple!!",
0,"My experience with Uber was in San Francisco in April 2017. Uber is still hiding in the shadow and will not come up front and center to pick you up, they lurk around the corner, and if the wait too long for you they cancel the ride. This is a damaged game of hide and seek.",
0,"I use Uber all the time, but I am officially done with this unprofessional company. Guess it would be a crime to be able to talk to someone in person at Uber. Uber is letting their drivers ripoff their riders. I have a service dog and in the last weeks have been charged twice a cleaning fee, without any input. The last one was for dirt spots on the seat that was already there. I am tired of drivers making extra money, whenever they feel like it. I am done being ripped off!!!",
1,** - Contact number of the driver. Absolutely not professional. I booked a cab and it showed me 3 minutes away. Again it changed to 6 minutes away. Followed by 9 minutes away. I called him to guide him through. He purposely kept the phone on speaker and pretended like he could not hear me. Uber has really disappointed me. HORRIBLE.,

0,"If you are in the Philadelphia area and your uber driver is Daemon, cancel it real quick. When she picked me up she was at the wrong address so I had to literally walk a 1/2 block to her car and when she called me to ask where I was at, she was rude, even though she was at the wrong house!Her car smelled very bad (musty and dirty clothes) and it was dirty! She had water bottles on the floor and crumbs on her seats. I couldn't even dust them off because of the kind of seats she had. So I sat in crumbs the entire ride to work.When it was time to drop me off, she was at the wrong location once again and I had to get out and walk a block to my building. She is by far the worst uber driver and I have had some bad drivers but she is flat out terrible.",

I had cancelled many times...it's not funny anymore "" Uber"" . I am almost done with you ""uber"". This company Sucks! I've been nice to all your drivers even if sometimes some of the uber driver's stinks I was still polite towards him. Now I download Lyft and will try it. Thank-you Uber!!!",
1,"Uber Atlanta Horrible - I did Rideshare. The driver confused me with the other person that took the ride. I requested to be picked up from the Aquarium and go to Mary Mac's Restaurant. If you look at where the driver took the client it was not to that place. Uber charged me $4.77 for a ride I never took and believed the driver over me. Rideshare should not be used If you can't account for who took the ride. I was never picked up, the driver simply confused me with the other person. I had 3 rides scheduled but only picked up one time. Unfortunately, because of their growth, there's no way to account for what is real and not. I had the same problem in Washington D.C. but was able to get refunded.",
0,I ordered Uber in Seattle on 6/17. I was getting off a cruise ship and needed to go into the city. I contacted the driver that never arrived. I then contacted another driver who wanted me to walk 3/4 of a mile to a Subway. My last encounter was a driver who wanted to charge me $45 for a short ride.,
0,"I used Uber regularly a few years ago, then my driver got in an accident on the way to pick me up so I had to hop a train. The next time, a driver came to pick me up but I could smell alcohol on his breath so I hopped a train again. The last straw for me was the driver who was late because he was being cited for causing an accident but he could be to my house about 20 minutes late. Never used them again. Now I use taxis whose drivers are licensed, bonded and insured.",
0,"Found myself in California, emergency trip, without transportation. Stranger in town. Called taxi for 16 mile trip to the hospital. Cost $58.00 and no way to afford that for long after paying for food and lodging. Called Uber after that. Less than half the cost and drivers always prompt, courteous, and helpful in recommending food, shopping and other necessities when asked. Got a mini sightseeing tour with every ride as they explained the surrounding area. Loved it. Thank you Uber.",
1,"I'm an avid Uber rider. On 9/30/2017, I ordered an Uber pool around 2pm. My fare was $8.98. The driver picked me up from my location. On the way to my dropoff, the driver picked up another passenger, dropped that passenger off. He proceeded to my dropoff, but he ended my ride by mistake. The driver had to load my dropoff address again. It's only after I got out the car, I realized my fare was duplicated. I've sent emails to UBER. They dont have customer relations, only email. They didnt refund me my money. On October 6, I used their service again. This time my fare was $30.92. This fare was obviously deducted from my Visa card and its also on my statement. On their app, UBER is claiming I have an outstanding payment, but I have PAID THEM. I need help.",
1,Uber charged me again for a wait time when I was outside waiting for the driver to pull up. Today I watched the driver pull up and got into the car. I even texted the driver my location beforehand so there would be no confusion. Then I look at my online receipt and I see the charge. This is the third time Uber has done this. I think it is a scam. I rated the driver really low and will change it once someone verifies that the drivers aren't responsible for this. I can't get anybody on the phone. Uber's customer service is atrocious. I can't keep using a service that tries to scam me at every opportunity.,

We were already in the street. There was no time to cancel and book a limo so we got in. As a result, our fare was augmented to $126. I complained and they reduced it to $114. I am still fighting for a fair settlement . Today I took a cab.",
1,"Worst experience of contacting Uber customer care. I left a sunglass and called within minutes of dropping, however they failed to connect the driver immediately and later sends an email saying they didnot find anything. This is ridiculous and highly unethical.",

Fares are 50-75% less than traditional cabs. Cars are clean and well maintained. Love Uber!",
0,New User. Tried to book a future pickup and thought we had. Realized that they dispatched a driver immediately and once I discovered this I cancelled.

0,"The Uber driver cancelled the trip himself without consulting me. I was waiting for the driver to pick me up. While I was waiting, I received the email that the trip is cancelled and I was charged R25. I struggled to get hold of them to solve the problem, because everything is online with them. I managed to submit my complaint with them online. They took about two hours to come back. A Mr ** told me I must check that the reverse the money back into my account, which is not true. They only reverse the amount which they would've charged me for the trip but not the cancellation fees. I sent Mr ** an email again and told him that I was not reimbursed with the cancellation fees. He replied to me with an attitude in bold that the driver must get paid for a cancelled trip and at the same time the attitude is ""what do you further want us to do. The matter is resolved and like leave it and keep quiet."" ",
0,"Uber's customer support via email is beyond words. The most horrible and worthless support group I have ever seen. These people don't read the cases, and subsequent replies are bizarre and repeat the previous CS rep reply. You will never have the same support rep even for the same case so there is no accountability or structure. It's quite unbelievable on all levels on how bad it is. At least as a writer you can dispute a credit card charge. But as a driver Uber can cheat you out of money and get away with it. I am a victim.",
0,"Uber came home faster for pick me up, the driver was a courteous and wait for me more than 4 minutes without charge me. The driver use a precaution and respect the speed limit.

1,"I have been a loyal user of Uber and it has always been my go-to means of getting from point A-B. But today, I've officially withdrawn and deleted their app. Heres why:
Two nights ago, I've ordered a cab for my girlfriend to get home after a huge argument around the time of 3 a.m. Keep in mind her phone died at the time. Her destination was from Manhattan to Brooklyn. The next day, she had told me she was dissatisfied with a pool customer who gave her an attitude and told my girlfriend to ""shut up"" after talking to the driver named Raja. She was tremendously upset to begin with and it caused her to get off the car a few blocks later, which took her to the 1 train. We are super easy going people and we have discovered the driver Raja, has NEVER ended the trip at the time she was dropped off- which was only 5 blocks later and had fully taken advantaged of the circumstances and drove an empty passenge car to her destination in Brooklyn. I did not fully realize this until it was too late - so I had rated him 5 stars before I got the chance to report him. Again we were in an argument so we didn't not talk until a day later.
First of all she and I were not drunk at all. And I have reached out to uber and they have refused to refund me for the amount of $27. Although the money is not the issue but the dishonest driver. I will be going to Lyft from now on. I do not regret my decision.
Also I notified uber and told them the details and these illiterate workers reviewing my complaint do not even respond to the problem but are confusing that I want a refund because the fare amount itself is wrong. I regret to say that Uber hires lousy drivers that take advantage of customers at 3am. and if they had looked into my transaction profile, I already spend quite a lot for cabs, theres no reason for me to go beyond for 27$ unless it was the truth",
0,"I have had several instances recently where I go to order and Uber tells me it's 2-3 minutes and then I confirm the order and it's 8-10 minutes (tech glitches).  I have also had drivers who can't speak English and I must tell them where to go despite them having their map app on their phone available to them.  Incompetent drivers and failing technology are not ingredients for a good user experience.  When notified of their failings, Uber curtly replies that they work hard to provide the best user experience.  Really, that's your best?",
0,"I've used Uber many times in CA and in MD. The app could be a bit more user friendly though. With the exception of one, all drivers have been friendly and have driven carefully. One time I had an issue with billing and customer service handled the problem immediately and to my satisfaction. I would definitely recommend Uber.",

0,"Earlier this year I attempted to apply as a driver but due to poor knowledge and a lack of direct communication provided by Uber I was unable to complete the hiring process. This company has no readily available personnel to assist you when you require immediate assistance. They simply direct you by text to attend an upcoming Uber meeting in some city if you have questions. They also collect and maintain personal driving records, personal identifiable information and documents of individuals who were unable to meet their requirements. Such information should be purged from their systems, not kept on file.",

0,"We only started using Uber this past year in Las Vegas, Nevada. A hotel staff member helped us download the app and use it. The drivers were very dependable, prompt and courteous. The cars were much cleaner than the cabs, and the rates were much lower. I am sorry to hear about the scandals that have recently besieged this company, and am hoping that the CEO's decision to take a leave of absence will help this company reform itself and improve its name. Unfortunately, Uber is not allowed to operate in my area, otherwise, my husband and I would use it more often.",

Our hotel offered to take us for $17 per person, but we opted to take Uber for the personal service and efficiency. We had an excellent driver and vehicle but when we arrived at the airport I discovered that Uber charged me $99.26! The worst part about Uber is that they make it so easy to book a trip but then they make it so difficult to contact them regarding any issues.",
0,"Uber drivers that I've dealt with have always been professional, safe drivers, and a pleasure to deal with. Their cars have always been clean, mostly newer models, and well-maintained. For the most part, the drivers get you in a short period time. However occasionally you might get a driver that suddenly realizes he doesn't want to take the call and you suddenly see on the map that he's going in a different direction. That could be frustrating when you're waiting for pick up, luckily, it has rarely happened. Overall, Uber is very good.",
0,"Uber arrived to pick me up within 10 - 15 minutes of being called. Clean, comfortable vehicles and good music. Courteous drivers and safe driving habits. During rush hour in an area I was very familiar with, a driver was willing to divert from his GPS directions and go the way I told him would avoid the traffic. But one driver was a little less accommodating and dropped me off with luggage to carry, across the street from my destination.",
0,"We were left STRANDED in rural Framingham MA, after dark, with no way to return to our hotel. My colleague is disabled and must use a cane. The evening which would have been memorable for many other reasons I am sorry to say will probably remain memorable because of Uber's actions. The problem all started when the driver showed up at our hotel, the Hotel Sheraton in Framingham, early on Saturday evening, September 24, 2017. We had dinner reservations for 5:30 that evening at a Framingham-area historic inn that both of us had been eagerly looking forward to visiting.",
0,"Arrived in LAX 8 hours ahead of schedule due to change of plans so our pickup wasn't available. My daughter suggested to try Uber so we did after comparing the fare going home which was about the same. A black shiny Suburban picked us up in less than 10 minutes. The van interior was clean so was the driver. He was pleasant to talk to and he drove us home safely. It was a pleasant experience that from now on, no more dirty taxis and smelly cab drivers for me.",
0,"Using UBER was a pleasant surprise and I love the fact that they are available on short notice. The prices are much more affordable than the taxi cabs I was using prior to UBER and fare payment via credit card is great. They offer and deliver good service which I felt was safe and everything already in the system and no need to pull out anything. I also tried UBER as driver for several months... It was fun! I only had one incident that caused me concern after calling UBER and confirming a ride. Between 11:00-11:30 pm close to a price surge time, I was switched to several different driver confirmations which caused a 45-minute wait and that night I finally called a cab.",
0,"I live in a very small town and at times there is no one available to pick up. Uber is great in large metropolitan areas. Drivers are very polite and punctual. I noticed that the ride would state a different amount, however after I am dropped off the price has increased. There is no customer service number. I understand that even the drivers don't have a main number to contact for Uber Corporate. That is a serious issue. Every company should have a human to speak with for concerns.",
0,"I will and always have admitted, it's not about loyalty but business. I supported uber in the past because they were getting the job done better than the cab companies. And in a sense they are still more efficient than the dying breed of the cab industry. However there are and will continue to be more rideshare business. Look what Napster did to the music industry and look where Napster is now? Uber has gone down hill for me as this whole rating thing has gotten out of hand. I am on time for my driver, respectful (treating them the way I want to be treated), and despite not liking the tipping I still do it. I don't like the rating as it's pointless. If I give the driver a bad rating legitimately they will and have rated me poorly. Anything less than a 5/5 for a driver is ""wrong"". So the passenger gets bullied into giving them a perfect score. Then there is this tipping which I have been in the service industry and support it but UBER was all about the no tipping and now if you don't tip enough or worse on time, the driver rates you poorly. Personally, I don't care if a drive likes me or not but when my rating can impact me getting a ride, this is where the problem is.Some examples I dealt with is I had a driver in Montreal who didn't speak English and I did the best I could to communicate in French and so my rating goes down. In Phoenix, my driver was soliciting his private driver business and when I couldn't use his same thing. And most recently in Seattle one driver was so depressing talking about how she has no friends and that she doesn't know Seattle well. I had to end up using my own gps using international Data and yet now I get a bad review. I was scared to give this lady a 4/5 yet alone worse. And I have gained other example.I have supported UBER coming to Calgary and Edmonton, even when they were booted out temporarily. Now that I live near Vancouver, I was supporting them coming there as well. Now, I'm starting to change my mind.My point is now I'm considering going with other options including the awkward hailing of a cab! Regardless, ride sharing will continue to grow, the question is, will UBER be a part of this or eventually not exist like Napster, being just another company that started a trend?FYI they make it hard for you to contact them with complaints unless you say you were in an accident.",
0,"I have used Uber 3 times. Once the driver got lost, causing me to miss my bus and costing me $60 extra fare. The other times were ok but I believe way overpriced. Sorry, not a fan.",
0,I used Uber for a couple of medical appointments. The drivers were prompt and so friendly and I could not have been happier. The cars were spotless and I had lots of floor space. The rides were smooth because the cars were very nice and that's important with all my back issues. I highly recommend Uber to anyone and everyone!,
0,"The service was convenient (just a phone call and they came to our location). The drivers were always on time, courteous, and helpful. Their fee was usually less than the commercial cab fares and the vehicles were all clean and efficient.",
0,It's a really great thing. They should have more incentives for discount rides after you build up lots of rides or give them references for business. But other than that they are very safe and a great concept.,
0,"I am in a non-profit organization that is financially assisting seniors with no other transportation choices to use Uber via 24-Hour Care home health. Our Friends of Outreach will pay the app fees and the charge for rides for vetted seniors through the non-profit via the city of Irvine. Certain seniors who don't have access to a phone that can connect the apps, and also don't meet the criteria for use of other transportation modes we support financially, are using the service on a trial basis on 12-week contracts. So far so good.",
0,"Quick and efficient service, clean cars, and polite staff. Sets the standard our local cab services should aspire to. All this at half the price.",
0,"My son booked me an Uber to take me to the station to catch a train to the airport. When I got in the driver started going at about one mile an hour and drove up loads of little side roads, going round in circles in completely the wrong direction and wasting a good 15 minutes. When I told him I had a train and flight to catch he suddenly said he was looking for other customers because it was a shared ride. I rang my son who said it definitely wasn't shared and to tell the driver to get a move on. He refused to. I asked could he then change it to unshared and charge the extra and he said no. I asked him to call his superior and he said there was nobody there to call. I explained that if I missed the one train an hour I'd miss my flight and there wasn't another one for seven days. Effectively I'd lose my whole holiday. He shrugged and carried on at one mile an hour. There was nothing I could do and even if I'd got out of his car he'd taken me down such quiet roads there was no chance of finding another cab. This was 3am in the morning and eventually after much screaming on my part he gave up looking for sharers - but I made it to the station with two minutes to spare and had to to try and run up numerous platform steps with two pieces of heavy luggage. I will never forget the experience and will never ever use them again.",
1,"When in Ann Arbor the Uber driver was polite and helpful but when in Chicago most drivers DID not come out of the car or speak unless we spoke except to ask where to. Also, the driver was not especially courteous or helpful. This was my first encounter with using Uber.",
0,"I use UBER when I go to Pittsburgh when my daughter wants me to go shopping, and doesn't want me to walk. She lives in Stanton Heights and the store is Shop-N-Save on Butler St in Lawrenceville and I feel very safe taking an UBER.",
0,Drivers will accept then never show. This has happened over 7 times. I've only been riding with Uber for a few weeks. Uber has made me late work because they say they're coming and never show up and then won't cancel the ride on their end so the company charges my card for the ride that's didn't show and a cancellation fee.,
0,"Used Uber once. Great experience and great concept for getting around without a great expense. Thought about making extra money as a driver. Rules for personal safety are for me. Overall, good business.",
1,"I waited through several drivers. I was in an unfamiliar neighborhood, but did describe my location adequately. When a driver finally showed up, he was hearing impaired; there was some difficulty making myself understood, but did make it to the airport in time, esp. as the flight was delayed. He drove quite fast, taking shortcuts. Made me a little concerned about safety.",
0,"They were always prompt, knowledgeable, courteous and professional. They are ideal for when you are out of town and I plan to use them often.",
0,"My child and my girl need to go to school early in the morning, I request an Uber taxi who cleverly went to the destination to pick my family (**) and then he call me, ""I am here where you at?"" I reply, ""In front of my building"" and he said of the put the wrong address to put up but the driver did not say nothing if he coming or not. I trying to call him back and an automate it machine say that I have to call from my account phone number and the driver charge me for nothing, well my babies are late for school. I decide to request another car and in the map said 4 minutes. Well I thought maybe with this other car they can make it??? The driver (**) cancel literately in front of the building and this is not the right way they do business and treat your customer. And both were late - one for school and the other to college. Good job UBER.",
0,"Uber is so much better in urban areas than my car. A local that knows the route, burn less gas, does not need to park, and gives us an explanation of town is a joy.",
0,I have used Uber many times and I have had good experiences 99% of the time. I like the convenience of the automatic payment and most of the drivers are great as well.,
0,Driver was prompt and friendly. Found out drivers rate passengers (they can alert other drivers of potentially be or aggressive riders) and passengers can rate the drivers which becomes company knowledge.,
0,"I used Uber during my stay in Las Vegas, Nevada and it was a good experience. I was taken directly to my destination and arrived right on time and Uber driver was a very friendly lady and I really enjoyed laughing and talking with her during the trip.",
0,"My first experience with Uber was taken from Seattle Airport. The vehicle was really clean and the driver was very courteous, safe driver and professional.",
1,Warning uber is a scam and there is no customer service and there drivers are drunks and drug addicts and sexual harassment,
0,"I just had a terrible experience with Uber pool. I ordered it for the first time yesterday on a route that I've taken many times before with UberX. My phone is older, so the Uber app does not allow me to see the fare before requesting an Uber pool ride. However, I'd taken this ride so many times before with UberX and the cost was never more than $50. I figured since Uber pool claims to be up to 40% cheaper that UberX and it's a shared ride, I should be fine. Boy was I wrong! I ordered the pool and waited the estimated time but didn't see the car. I received no phone call either. Finally I noticed the car a half a block down past where I was standing. I went to the car and was told to get out because he had already cancelled. I was charged a $5 cancellation fee.",
0,"I absolutely love Uber! They are very convenient, quick and for the most part very safe. I use Uber every day and I've only had a few issues which weren't that traumatic. As of this point, I don't know what I would do without Uber. I rely on them to go everywhere and in the case of needing to go to an event where it's going to be packed, with parking being horrible, Uber is a no-brainer. They drop you off close to the event, you don't have to worry about paying for a high prices parking spot. Overall, I am very happy with Uber.",
0,I've always found Uber reliable and professional nationwide. They are my go-to choice for transportation when I travel for business or pleasure.,
0,PROS: Really easy to use and fast arrival time of the car. CONS: Background check doubtful and sometimes car description is not accurate.,
1,"My driver was personable, and made me feel safe. It was good to come across a patriot rather than the grunts and groans one usually encounters with car service drivers.",
0,"The driver we had was very professional and polite and he was easy to talk to and understand. He was also nicely dressed along with being very helpful with other points of interest that we might like. Plus, he took good care of his vehicle and kept it very clean. Because of him we will be glad to try Uber again if needed.",
0,We didn't want to drive in San Francisco after parking at our hotel. We used Uber 4 times and found the response times fast and the drivers courteous and careful to obey laws. We knew about the higher prices at rush times and were not surprised at the higher but reasonable charge during the one time we rode at 5:30 pm. We will use Uber again on our trips to unfamiliar cities.,
0,New driver over 2 hours online - Trying to contact UBER is literally impossible. I was sent a delivery message which lasted approx 1 second and then disappeared. I then went on my first call and was unable to slide to commence the ride. When I did slide it I was virtually at the destination. Being unable to contact UBER to explain anything is a total waste.,
0,Uber is a great service. There are places that don't have the privilege of having buses or even a taxi for a ride. It's great for some of our citizens that need to get to doctor appointment. Uber has also provided a lot of people with jobs!,
0,"I used Uber for the first time in the Washington, DC area several months ago. My son who lives there showed me how to use the app; within just a few minutes, our ride arrived and we were safely back at our location. Waiting for public transit would have been over an hour transport time. The driver was very professional and nice.",
1,"I enjoy the cheap cost, but I feel saddened by the negative impact on the taxi drivers that have far better qualifications to drive people around. So many Uber drivers do not know the area in which they drive and are not safe drivers, often not obeying basic driving rules.",
0,"I was in L.A. and a friend had the Uber account and software on her phone so she put-in the requests. I used Uber twice (maybe three times) in L.A... They were fairly short rides that went very, very well. The drivers were very friendly and the cars they were driving were newish and clean.",
0,I ordered an Uber today @ 9:45 for a 10:00 appt I had at the doc. At first I was told to walk over two blocks to meet the driver for my convenience. I waited around 15 minutes and kept on tracking the driver but no car showed up. After thoroughly checking the entire block I found him across the street. I quickly ran over but he informed me that my ride was cancelled and I'll have to order a car again. I did and they assigned me another driver (not this one) five minutes away. That driver canceled me after five minutes. I ordered another one but he never showed. I ended up walking the 1.2 mile to my appt. I will never use Uber again. They have absolutely no reliability and no customer service. I will try Lyft in the future.,
1,"I had 4 guests (5 of us total) so ordered an Uber XL, which is advertised to seat 6 people. When I pulled up the order, I had the choice of an Uber X for $15 or an Uber XL for $35. Knowing that there would be 6 people with the driver, I ordered the Uber XL. When the car arrived, it was a small SUV (5 passenger vehicle) and the driver told us to ""squeeze in"". I have emailed Uber numerous times about this issue and have had no luck getting anything but an automated response saying that the issue has been resolved and that I should order an Uber XL for larger groups (which is what I did, but did not get an Uber XL). I have requested the $20 refund for the price difference with no success. It is not necessarily about the $20 - it is the principle. And it is also illegal for them to drive with 4 people ""squeezed in"" the back seat. It was embarrassing to me, as these were out of town guests. I do have 4 other witnesses that can verify the size of the vehicle.",
0,Used their service for a week of vacation in downtown Chicago. Drivers were always available and service was quite prompt. The drivers and vehicles were clean and they were concerned for our safety by good driving practices. Even the pickup and drop off from the USA women's soccer game in Soldiers field was accomplished to our satisfaction even though the area was crowded with spectators. The prices were very reasonable. Very satisfied with the service.,
0,"I used Uber services when I was going to a family get together. The driver was on time, polite and had good everyday conversation with me and the children.",
0,"I like the Uber app which lets me know where their cars are in proximity to my location, who my driver is, what car they are driving and when they will arrive to pick me up. I love that I do not have to tip. I get in the car and the driver already knows where I want to go. I get out as soon as we arrive and immediately get an opportunity to rate the driver. The service is great.",
1,"First time I used Uber, they were great. The second time, they got lost trying to find me (I was at a public high school) and just gave up. They texted me to cancel. Didn't even call to try to work anything out or send another driver. I won't be using them again.",
0,"I had to use Uber for a few occasions when my car needed repair. I used the app which is really convenient to use. It shows you what cars are in your local area, how close they are to your location. They show you who the driver is, and approximately how soon they can arrive. I found that my drivers were polite, good drivers. I will use them again as needed.",
0,"Uber is great for transportation for medical appointments. The call center has always been prompt and courteous with me. The drivers I've had in the past have been very caring and loyal to their customers. They were pleasant, caring, compassionate, and humorous as well. The only thing that has ever bothered me is the extensive wait time for pickup from my appointments. Uber puts more on their drivers than should be in my opinion. I have personally seen the stress and anxiety in the drivers.",
0,"Not a real frequent user, but every experience the same. Close by, on time, good drivers, nice conversation if we initiate, safe to destination, no problem at the end of the ride.",
0,It's an economic and convenient service. I like the convenience of the app and being able to track just where my driver is. I've never had any situations that I felt were unsafe or threatening.,
0,I started using UBER while on vacation in Arizona a couple years ago. Took it to and from the airport. I was shocked on how easy it was! I LOVE that there is no money that exchanges hands at all. I was a little leery about providing my credit card info when I signed up but I've never had a problem. I've used UBER so many times since then in different places... Like Chicago! It's just so much cheaper than a cab plus the drivers are usually very friendly and like to tell you about different places to visit (if you're a tourist). Recently I was on a trip to San Francisco and used UBER the whole time. Something new I learned about while there was UBER POOL. The driver picks up a number of people at different stops and drops everyone off at their pre-determined destination and it was only $4.99 per trip because you are sharing a ride with others. Very cool!,
1,"There were two representatives for Uber at Westfield mall in Escondido yesterday, one ** one **. The ** man was staring at women's behind as they walked by! That was offensive for me to see and I let the ** man know it. He said ""Thank you"" and he would take care of it but man come on!!! What do you think he is like when he is alone with female passengers!!!",
0,"Uber began as a very reputable alternative to other livery services, however, that has changed. Rates are quoted as one amount and billed higher. The drivers are miserable, some of them actually hit their female customers. Uber's customer service is literally non-existent and with the exception of booking a car, all of their online services are at best horrible.",
0,"Uber is great as long as you are traveling by yourself or with someone over age 4. If you're a single mom with a baby there are ZERO cars that offer baby seats. You are expected to lug a seat with you which is horrible if you are trying to go out shopping or something. You can't exactly lug around a giant car seat. Single moms need an option too. There also aren't many women drivers, I have only seen one.",
1,"Rates are very reasonable. Pickup times are pretty prompt. However, sometimes they come early then charge for wait time and a few times I had to wait on them. Cars are usually very clean and comfortable. Drivers are not always chatty so it depends on preference if you like to talk or not, BUT they are concentrating on GPS etc. One driver I had didn't stop for stop signs and he must have thought the signs said ROLL.",
0,"Uber sucks big time and simply laugh at all complaints. They only care about making money, at the expense of the drivers and riders. Uber should be put out of business permanently.",
0,Same of your drivers have different things in their car. All drivers should care some extra things but I have always been happy with the service.,
1,"I've used Uber many times in the past but I would never use Uber now! Many times I have been billed for rides where the driver literally drove right by me, and I'd have to call for another ride. You are automatically billed $5 if you miss your pickup. INSANITY! The procedure to get your $5 back that has literally been stolen from you is so time-consuming. It simply isn't worth the bother. I already had an unsatisfactory opinion of Uber - before all the HORRIBLENESS that they are today, June 13th 2017... So I'd say, try to catch a Lyft with someone else!",
0,"My granddaughter and I ordered an uber from santa monica beach pier . Three drivers cancelled and I was charged for the third one with them stating that the driver waited over 2 minutes for me. I was at the pickup point long before I ever contacted this driver. He evidently left  and charged me with a cancellation fee and I followed the rules. Uber has shown to a very shadowy company from the get go. From now on, I will be a customer of Lyft! I have disputed this with the BBB, no response from uber so now I am making you aware.",
0,"I suddenly became very ill at work. I usually take the bus home, but was too ill to do that. I got on my phone and saw that many Uber vehicles were already circling my block at work, so a vehicle arrived promptly, before I could even come down on the elevator. The driver was a woman who was a previous healthcare worker, and she assured me that I could relax, and not to worry. If I got sick she could take care of me. Talk about customer service! She was so kind, I immediately felt better.",
0,"Both Uber vehicles were not clean, old and uncomfortable. Although no tip was required I offered and they accepted. Not overly pleased with the rides.",
0,"I started using Uber about four months ago. My first two rides went perfectly. I was able to state where I was located, as well as the two locations that I wanted to go to. However, the third time that I wanted to use Uber, I was no longer able to put in two locations, just one. I didn't realize that at that point, and only realized it once a driver was driving me to my primary location. My driver was amazing enough to drive me to my second location; as thanks for this, I paid him with the few dollars that I had in my wallet.",
1,Uber is very convenient and reasonable. I have used it often and have only been disappointed once. That time the driver took a longer route to my house. I rated the driver low and Uber contacted me right away and modified my trip charge!,
0,"The first time I used Uber was in SF. Several times they were fantastic, then NYC that was not as great but still very good. Just took longer in NYC and not as friendly.",
0,"Uber is great because I have used it in India, Singapore and got great rates in the US too. They have special deals and I wish they had more of those because it makes it so much competitive with the mass transit.",
0,"Uber is a scam and a pyramid scheme! They always find new and ingenious ways to rip off their drivers, riders and even their own employees. I hope they crash and burn.",
1,"When my wife died a few states away the Sunday before Thanksgiving 2016, I needed to get home to NJ. They were awful at Newark Airport. Some drivers came ""disguised"" as UBER drivers and would not take me where I NEEDED to go. Nor were some of them UBER drivers to begin with. 2 Drivers put me & luggage in car, pulled away from EWR, asked where to, heard where to and said, ""Sorry, get out."" They are never available in Suburbia late at night and very early AM.",
0,"Terrible experience with Uber service today. The rider Roger, Chrysler 300, 7LHV109 accepted my ride request but never showed up and ignored my calls and text messages. My App showed he was sitting near a shopping plaza a mile away instead of picking me up. After 35 minutes in the heat, my cell phone died and I had to take a taxi. Terrible service! And Uber charged me money for its driver's failure!",
0,"The Uber drivers that we used were OK. One was creepy and the other two ladies were nice. The one thing they all had in common, they were SLOW. They drive way below the speed limit and I felt like I was never going to get to my destination.",
0,"I have used Uber all over the world and it has always been prompt and convenient, as well as cheaper than a standard taxi. The drivers have always been polite and some have also been more friendly. I do have reservations about many aspects of the so-called gig economy and feel a little guilty when I use services such as Uber, but I cannot fault the service I have received as a customer.",
0,"I've taken Uber only half a dozen times, and all but one were pleasant experiences. The unpleasant experience went beyond the pale however. I probably could have contacted Uber during the ride and I'm sure arrangements would have been made to care for the problem, as their customer service has always been stellar. All told, Uber has been a lifesaver on those occasions I didn't want to drive.",
0,I have used Uber as a passenger and I am a part-time driver with them. I get outstanding rating and comments from my passengers. I would like to see more of the drivers I get also really care about the passenger they are transporting (me).,
0,"For the most part, Uber is convenient and fast. Need a way to tip. 1 driver with road rage, but very much the exception. Still way better vetting than taxis.",
0,"This was one old, small, worn out Uber vehicle for an hour trip to the airport. Ft Collins to Denver airport. But the driver was friendly and drove safely.",
0,Used Uber while in Boston MA. Driver was excellent and knew his way around during peak driving time after work. We used Uber 3 times and always got to our destination on time.,
0,"I have used Uber many times, and each time I have been exceedingly pleased. The drivers were prompt, courteous, and professional. I highly recommend Uber.",
0,"Great for the rider, they get quick service. Poor pay for the drivers due to a flooded market. No concern given to the fact that if you hire too many drivers there will not be enough riders to make the trips worth your time and fuel.",
0,"The experience with Uber is entirely dependent on the driver. One driver took excellent care of me while another driver almost left me off miles from my destination in an industrial park, not a hotel. I threatened to call the police.",
0,"Please, please use Lyft or a cab service. Uber is just awful. I had a driver verbally abuse me this morning, so I asked Uber for a full refund. They gave me a $5 credit, and basically said they don't think my situation warrants a full refund. Clearly this company supports abusive drivers over their customers. I will NEVER be using their services again.",
1,"I was picked up from my workplace on 30/8/2017 at around 8:56 pm by cab no. TN 07 CE 8554. The trip started on my account but the drivers account was not updated. navigation kept directing the driver to my pick up point. finally after taking a full circle and wasting my time he called up customer service. the executive directed him to cancel my ongoing trip and ask me to book another assuring that the same cab will be assigned. the driver cancelled and when i booked again i was assigned a ride 20 min away. the driver asked me to get off on the street amidst a downpour. when i refused to get off away from my pick up point, while it was raining and demanded to talk to customer service again, the driver called up the office again but refused to let me speak. customer service executive told him to tell me that i am not being charged for the trip so get off. I have never seen such behavior in my life. the moment you undertake the responsibility of a trip, you are taking responsibility for our time, safety and good service delivery and in return take payment from us. you cannot waste our time, compromise our safety and then put us through discomfort and finally say 'ok we won't charge you this time'. looks like uber is no better than a bunch of scoundrels with no work ethics or standards.",
1,"I left my phone in the Uber. I could not log in to my account because Uber needs multi factor authentication, meaning they were sending codes to the lost phone. *facepalm*. Because why else would I need to log into my Uber account from another device... So I tracked my phone to its location. Politely asked for my phone back and was refused. Though it was not the driver that picked me, he also ""just happened"" to be another Uber driver.",
0,"I just wanted to write and let all of you at Uber that I had the most amazing driver the other day! As soon as I got in the car, he handed me a bowl of delicious treats, I thought that was so sweet! Then he handed me a bottle of water.  This may not be a big deal to some, however, it actually made my day! He was so polite, helpful, generous and all around awesome!!! Please please let this driver, Jasur Nazarou # 5756433 know that he is awesome!! He deserves some sort of praise from all of you at Uber! All of your drivers should take notes from this guy!

0,"Car went to wrong address. Was filthy. Charged me 3 x the estimate!!!!!! Never again. Crap, crap, crap, crap.",
0,I had to request a pickup several times since the drivers were waiting for it to be midnight for the price surge. They were cancelling my pickup and I was getting charged for the cancellation. The next day the driver said she couldn't find me although the next driver had no issues. I was again charged a cancellation fee. The unprofessional driver hung up on me when I was giving specific directions trying to make it easier to find me. I was visiting LA and staying in Santa Monica. These experiences somewhat soured my trip.,
0,She continually amazed me with her skill and expertise on the road. She was very kind and courteous and knew every possible avenue of travel. Props to Uber for their fine selection.,
0,"I will never understand why the drivers of the self driving UBER CAR in Tempe Arizona. Are not drugged tested, I know a few that would test positive. How could UBER put the risk of peoples, lives at risk. Also open their self up for a huge lawsuit.",
0,I recently took an Uber and was checking my trips the next day and see that I was being charged a cleaning fee of $150. My driver's name was Michael and picked me up in Delray Beach Florida and dropped me off in Boca Raton Florida. The ride cost $18.42. When I asked Uber through the Uber help I was advised I was being charged a cleaning fee. I then received pictures of vomit that was on the seat and the floor. This was something that I absolutely did not do. I have asked that the community manager in my area call me and I have not received any response. These pictures that were submitted were not from me. I feel violated and feel nothing I can do but dispute these charges with my bank.,
0,"I requested an UberX, and was told he'd arrived, ""Will ** (Willie)""... I made my way outside only to find him gone. I checked my App to see if he'd canceled, only to find that I was ""on my way"". How could that be, if I was still home. I emailed Uber about this situation, Harsh ** asked for details. I responded providing screenshots, and after 3 hours of waiting and hearing nothing, I was told they wouldn't be issuing a refund because based on the trip details, it ""looks like the trip took place""... SMH, WTF. I even offered to provide a picture of myself, and asked them to contact the driver about whom he picked up, but to no avail. Thoroughly disgusted with Uber.",
1,"I never knew there is going to be such difficult task to contact Uber's customer service about an issue me and my husband had. In fact there is no customer service per se but a critical safety response line which wasn't much of the help in our problem. What happened is that my husband left in Uber his wallet with all his documents, id cards, credit cards, pictures etc. He really got stressed out about it a lot, we contacted Uber through an app right away as we were not able to reach the driver. You must know that you really can't reach the driver even though the Uber app would transfer your call to him. The driver never picked up his phone nor there was a voicemail set up so we could leave a message. From Saturday night until Monday night we didn't know anything about the lost wallet. At least he could call back or e-mail us that he found or didn't find it.",
0,"I finally caved and opened an account with UBER in order to take a ride from Hallandale to the Fort Lauderdale Airport to fly home. I was under the impression that the first ride was free, but I could not find the place to enter the code. Nevertheless, I was picked up and dropped off for a charge of $17.94. Once at the gate, I thought I would go back into the app and learn about it, and perhaps discover where to enter promo codes. That's when I saw that a second charge of $97.94 had been applied. To make a long story short, and after a number of back and forth emails with UBER, it seems that my driver Yuniel, who could not speak a word of English, claimed that my dog (which I do not have) had urinated all over his seats. The UBER reply after the fourth email included photos.",
0,"I live in San Francisco (city) and have been using Uber for about two years. About six months ago I had the first issue with two drivers that I had to report for violations. My score has always been 5 stars until then, but Uber is allowing drivers to leave a negative rating for riders that have reported them or left a negative feedback due to unprofessional, rude, dangerous behavior. My score dropped to 4.85 because of that. Yesterday afternoon I correctly and honestly paid for two seats (me and my spouse), and when the driver arrived the car only had one seat available. When we asked him to cancel the ride, he denied our request multiple times and stared at us in a creepy way. When he heard we were going to contact Uber immediately, he left us on the sidewalk with bags and kept on making us pay for a ride we weren't benefitting of.",
0,"I ordered an Uber to get to an interview in Tempe and I live in Gilbert. I had the same Uber drive to and from the interview... David. On the ride there he charged me the normal amount. Then on the way back he charged me an extra 50$ for an ""accident"" in the car. There was no accident I was at an interview! I would love to know what I did. They make up accidents so that they can make more money. It is ridiculous. This is one of the worst company's to use. DO NOT USE THEM. Use lyft they are way more trustworthy and will not cheat you and take your money!",
0,"I was recently in Seattle for a fun trip. Used Uber several times without a problem. But then all of a sudden they charged me $250 out of nowhere to which they never did respond. But thank God my bank denied that fee. Then I asked for a ride, they cancelled on me, yet said I was not at the location I requested, then charged me $5 for a cancelled ride, NOT!!! And trying to contact customer service is a joke, to say the least. I have not used Lyft yet but will now be checking that out. Uber is a big rip off be careful out there!!!",
0,The drivers are rude and refuse to come at the pickup location _ Drivers Name : Kamaljeet PB 01A5756. They have an excuse of getting charged for the parking lot. as well when asked to come at pick location straight away says no. Another person in the que is Baldev with Car number,
0,"I'm a Uber driver and I took a couple of riders happens to be a husband and wife. When I picked up the riders, the women (wife) was badly intoxicated and sitting on a sidewalk. It was my first time so I didn't know what will happen next. I picked them up from LA and we're headed to Torrance at 1 am. By the time I nearly got to their destination, the wife threw up in my car. The husband helped catch the puke onto his shirt but since it's liquid, most of the throw up soaked into my back leather seat and couldn't do anything about it. I did completed the trip to their home and they got out of the car. ",

1,"ON 7/30/17 I was in Oregon alone on a trip at the University needing a ride to PDX to get home to CA. I chose Uber over Lyft because they had a driver available and the time of arrival worked for me, I was to arrive at 5:11 to the airport PDX which would have been plenty of time. But with him getting lost to me looking for gas. And me having to use the app to guide him to my pick up locations I ended up being 45minutes late which therefore made me miss my plane. I'm sorry. This is unacceptable from Uber, feeling helpless at the time and that was not what I was quoted. My time that you gave me was to ARRIVE at 5:11 to PDX that gave me 1:35 min to catch my flight I WAS 45 minutes late!",
0,I feel compelled to let people know they are not the only one seeing hidden charges show up after a ride. I recently was in Boston and actually ran down the street to get in the car early so the driver did not have to stop up further in heavier traffic and was charged a wait time charge? How the heck does that work? No response from Uber yet as just wrote to them. The driver was very nice and a good ride to my destination but that fee is so pumped up just to make more money and I was right at the door of the address I put in that Uber agreed to pick me up at for $14 ride.,
0,"I contacted Uber for a ride, August 2, 2017, at about 9:00 PM. The first was a no show. The driver notified me that he could not pick me up. But, I was charged a $5.00 fee! Could not contact Uber to protest this charge. I will never use Uber again.",
0,"I have only been able to successfully use the app once. Whenever I have tried to get a ride it says ""check your connection"". It never seems to have a problem with my connection when it comes to excessively texting me messages, urging me to become a driver or remembering my credit card information. I never requested info to become a driver, only a rider. When I went online to contact ""customer service"", my only option was to fill in a generic field box.",
0,It's August 2nd here in Dallas Texas and it is raining very hard. I called for an Uber ride to go to an ortho appointment that I have at Parkland Hospital. I was involved in horrific accident in January and my leg was nearly severed and it was saved from being amputated. I've been in a wheelchair for months today was my first to leave the house without a wheelchair or a walker to go to an appointment. It was pouring rain and the driver pulled up.,
0,"I had good experience with almost 50% of the drivers but some can be very dishonest. I Had to use Uber a lot during the month of May/June 2017 due to and accident that prevented me from driving.
Case #1: The driver charged me 100% more of the initial fare. He reported we were more than 4 riders. Not true. We were just my husband and I. After many claims from my part Uber eventually refunded me.
Case #2: The driver reported that we changed the destination address. Not true. He charged 100% more of the initial fare. Uber never refunded me.
Case #3: The driver charged me 100% more of the initial fare. She reported that I didn't provide the correct destination address. I explained to her that it must have been a system glitch. I was late for the appointment with my doctor because of that. She reported me to Uber as if I made racial discrimination remarks. NOT TRUE. I contacted Uber and demanded a meeting with the driver to clarify that offensive report. Uber never was able to sustain the driver's claim and eventually they opted to ignore my messages. Very disappointing experience.
I might use Uber in the future but I'll be very cautious checking the charges before I leave the car after the service. And I would advice to customers to do the same.",
0,"I am an active user of Uber and so, when I saw the service was available in France during my recent vacation, I used Uber rather than a taxi. I left my iPhone in an Uber last Thursday in Bordeaux. I immediately tried to log in to my account and contact the driver but apparently, because I was in another country, they required I provide a verification code - which was sent to my phone, which was in the Uber driver's car. My friend, who is also an Uber user, contacted Uber through her app to file an inquiry on my behalf. We have no less than 10 emails from Uber customer service, a different person each time, asking me/her to file an inquiry online - which would always lead to the service sending a verification code to the phone.",
0,"In Kadubeesanahalli at 11.00 AM on 31/07/2017, in front of 'Prestige Tech Park' the Uber driver hit my vehicle from right side. I stepped down to find out why he did that. I asked him ""when there is lot of space why you hit my car?"" He replied saying, ""I want to go to the left edge of the road immediately so I hit your vehicle. If I hit your vehicle you will stop so I can go the left edge of the road to drop my passengers."" This is how the Uber drivers are. Uber is encouraging and teaching their drivers to hit and kill people in order to drop their passengers on time. We are on one way road. He at least does not know that it is one way. He says ""this is two way so I can go to any direction that I want."" Very strange people on earth. This is how the social responsibility of the Uber is. Great organization.",
0,Requested a Uber in Las Vegas.  Was standing in front of the Uber designated pickup spot for hotel when ordered Uber.  Contacted driver after waiting 25 minutes.  He said I was at wrong spot hung up on me and cancelled my pickup and charged me.  Uber refuses to refund that charge.  I've contacted them several times and they send me the exact generic email saying no refund.  Horrible customer service will never use Uber again.,
1,"My first time experience with Uber was objectionable!  Signed up as a first time rider with Uber under a promotion called Chase50.  Offer was for 50% off for first timers for the first 2 trips thru July 31, 2017.  Had a difficult time to get the first one honored and the second one was lamely refused.  Their app is terrible!  It willl not allow a promotion code to be accepted.  Communication thru the app is rigid and tortuous and the usual 800 number in the charges description won't allow any  incoming calls only refers you back to their app which is worthless. And to top it all the second driver's conduct and dress code was second rate to put it mildly.  Thank goodness for Lyft which I have been using all along without any problems whatsoever.  Their driver's professionalism is top rate.   Even their promotions are automatic.  I will erase Uber app not to use them ever again.",
1,My uber driver stole my money out of my account. 47 dollars. His name was Michael. License plate **. Be careful he will charge you extra. My ride came up to 7 dollars and they will make up things to take out money out of your account. Uber is very unprofessional.,
0,"I'm driving for uber, of course as idea uber is a very unique company but bottom line it is taxi company. Only in taxi companies drivers may be non professionals but in uber company I can't see anything that american. Number one being unique company it's not enough to be the great company, and bet is very dirty cheating company, and they cheat not only customers, they cheat drivers, and that automatically mean they cheat government. I warn every customer, driver check your trips mileage and time and compare with charges and you will be surprised that is not matching reality, some small some big but it will be different. Even small different is cheating and if you may multiply that cheating to quantity of trips daily it will be millions, monthly will be billions. Is this is American way? I don't think so.",
0,I waited at the same spot at the airport. Car was 7 minutes away. I waited for 15 minutes until the car arrived. Yet Uber charged me waiting time!! The charge was very small but this is a question of principle and honesty. Is this due to improper reporting by driver and if so how can I correct this erroneous reporting. If it is Uber making a mistake how can I get this corrected? It is very difficult to contact Uber about customer issues. I have been an avid Uber rider but from now on I will look for other options.,
1,I used the Uber ride and secured Uber pool for the price of $18 and change. When I receive the receipt for the ride it was for $22 and change. I contacted Uber about the error and they insisted the price on the receipt was correct. This was clearly a case of price switching that Uber does not want to take responsibility for. Not to mention that the driver got lost several times using Uber's map system and I had to use the google app on my phone to get the driver pointed in the correct direction. Uber customer service was absolutely no help in this incident at all.,
0,I have had several recent issues with Uber. I requested an Uber in New Orleans and the driver never showed up. I followed the route and according to the driver they picked my husband and I up and dropped us off at our destination. This did NOT happen. We never received our ride but were charged for the ride nonetheless. When I contacted Uber about being charged but not receiving the ride they stated that the driver checked in and said the ride was given. We were left stranded and never received the ride.,
0,"I was going on vacation and called Uber, the driver showed up. I opened the door to acknowledge him and start to take out the suitcase. Before I took out the first suitcase the driver left and then charged me a fee. The second driver showed up and said he didn't know how to get to the airport so he too left and charged a fee. Finally I called Lyft and they showed up. However, they kept charging my card while I was in Scandinavia.",
0,"Driver Gurvinder ( car Tata Indica phone number *******861)in Chandigarh charged me Rs 401.51 instead of Rs 74.27.I entered the correct location and I was following the GPS till the drop off. And I was wondering how the driver changed the location because it was correct till he dropped me off. driver somehow changed it after that and charged me extra. This isn't fair- please check driver's phone or how he did it. And he didn't show me that he completed the trip and Once I got out of the car he did something on his phone. Same time I thought that something was wrong . now I can't trust Uber at all.
They charged me four times the fare I was supposed to pay and they didn't even confirmed me .I was shocked to see the email of 401Rs.
That's ridiculous. I have been doing lot of Uber rides but now onwards I want to tell everyone to keep a check on uber drivers in India.
This is very bad experience from uber. I thought Uber drivers were honest - didn't expect this at all.",
0,Driver passed me up then showed her on her way back then all of a sudden nothing. By cancelling it wanted to charge me 5.00$. Lost a ton of time and now I have to miss work. Because I didnt pick up my car before closing. Your driver just cost me a days work. Not happy!!! Lic plate#**.,
0,"I'm so sick of the ** Uber drivers, rude and disgusting attitude. We pay them and they have the nerve to have an attitude. Some of them have terrible driving skills to say the least. I asked a couple drivers if I could go run inside a location and come right out and go back to my home address which is basically a round trip. One of them told me yes. I came out after literally one minute 30 seconds and his ass was gone. Like who does that?? That is super inconvenient especially when booking another Uber just to get home in the middle of rush hour. On top of that it's $5 just to even get in the Uber before you even pull off. That's terrible.",

0,"Wasn't aware of their ""SURGE"" pricing, otherwise known as PRICE GOUGING. It seems if you request a ride when they're busy, you are charge more (a lot more!). I was charged 18.35 for 3/4 of a mile ride under 5 minutes. Driver said Uber does not share the inflated price with them.",

I was so upset when I saw 341.00 for the total this am!!!!!This is wrong and law suit worthy.  They need to make it very clear for the tired and apparently not bright to make a person realize that they will be stolen from a ludicrous amount.

1,"Tried to use them to get to the airport in S. Francisco. First driver showed up and told us he didn't have a permit to get to the airport, so we had to get another, then the price went up from $29 to over $40 in less than 2 mins. I was charged for 'cancelling'. Odd since I am a first time user and it wasn't my fault! Thought I would give them another chance at National Airport DC. Driver could barely speak English, could not tell me how much the ride would be because he said ""Uber set the price. I don't know how much."" WILL NEVER EVER BOTHER WITH UBER. I hope they don't last much longer. They are terrible, no way to contact anyone. I was charged TWO cancellation fees, would like a refund but good luck with that. Completely disgraceful treatment of its customers.",
0,"I was ripped off for $150 for cleaning fee. After a night out, I call uber and got a ride home. I got in the front seat and got home within 12 minutes. The ride is about $7. I got a receipt for about $7. I have no idea the driver file a charge of $150 for cleaning until I look in my credit card bill. I never received the receipt for the $150 until I complain to uber. Apparently, my driver file a cleaning fee to my ride with pictures of the middle back seat being wet and a little mess. I was sitting in the front seat. And if I don't get an alert that the charge was going to tag on, where is the avenue where I can contest this charge. The mess could have been made by the previous rider or the driver lied and file s false report. But if I don;'t get the alert right away, there is no way for me to contest this. That's why this is a scam. I will suggest all rider to take pictures of the interior of the car before leaving the car. Just to be safe so that you don't get rape by Uber.",

0,"I use my cards all over the world and have relied on taxis. My friends were telling me to try Uber so I did. The driver was great. However my payment wasn't accepted. The only customer service is by email which is more annoying than an IVR system. You get a response but you can tell it is either automated with the just the names changed or it is a copy and paste. There is no customer in their service. It's like speaking to a robot. I normally don't work with any company that doesn't have a customer service phone number and display it on their website, but I tried Uber because of the recommendations. After a couple of back and forth emails, they finally asked me to send photocopies of documents which further annoyed me. I probably won't use Uber again. I will take a taxi.",

They don't track how often he is doing this?!?,
0,"Most of customers are complaining about drivers being unprofessional because they passed nearby customer when the driver just received the request. The real thing is that Drivers are not responsible for SOFTWARE ISSUES!!! Uber is responsible for that. Uber need to adjust the software for server to pick up riders 3-4 minutes before arriving near customer, but because the programmers are following the UBER RULE to be aggressive taking very fast the customers, they cant solve real problems to pick up customers in a right order so no one cant mistake anything!! Like in a dual carriageway, server dont think that you need to turn around. ",

I see this as a problem because someone's child could be meeting up with a predator and end up dead somewhere... run away from home, etc. Nashville has got to do better and not just be concerned about making money. Be concerned about child safety.",

0,I took an Uber from Downtown Manhattan to Port Authority (42nd & 8th Ave.) and it costs $50!!! Are you kidding me right now!!! First of all the driver obviously didn't know what avenue to take even after I told him. 1 hour to get to midtown... pure BS. And why was it sooo expensive. Because the base fare is $7.00 and then $13.16 for 3.51 miles and then $31.51 for the 49 minutes that I wasted in the damn car. Grand total $51.67. Never again... And I would advise everyone to stay away from Uber if you don't want to get ripped off!!!,
1,"Up until 2 days ago, I had been an Uber partner for over a year and must say their practices are very questionable. 1st point, DRIVERS. How can a company claim they do ""background"" checks, and on countless occasions have the drivers be a bunch of menacing idiots, providing questionable rides in even more questionably safe cars, all the while being more focused on his/her phone conversation than the road. SERIOUSLY?! Now if these checks were, in fact, being done, then why the battle for not allowing drivers to be fingerprinted? It's an honest question, and quite frankly, a legit one. You claim your drivers are safe, but are unwilling to back that up with something so simple as fingerprinting?! LET THE BUYER BEWARE! ",

The driver was irritating kept asking how long have you been in Chicago.

 And then he drove me from towards langar houz and proceeded to nekhnampur from there to Manikonda, nearly covering some 20 kms in the traffic.  
These two designations are poles apart.  Ofcourse sharing is always time consuming.  I do agree    
But that should also be properly connected in the same route or beyond one destination or may extend to the bye lanes.
Definitely that cannot be coupled with this type of  two different directions , that too in this hyderabad traffic in the peak hours.  
So my advice is to refine the connectivity so that there will be more no. of commuters And again on second occasion, today you have clubbed me with another who travels to entirely a different destinationToday also the same thing happened 
you have clubbed customers travelling in two different routes thereby causing chaos between us and good amount of delay in the travel.  I picked up at 9.00 
IF YOU POOL CUSTOMERS TOGETHER WITH DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.  Really this is not expected from you 
YOU WILL BE A FAILURE IN UBER POOL
GO DOWN MY BOOKING HISTORY AND ESPECIALLY TODAY'S ROUTE AND IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCERN FOR CUSTOMERS TRAVELLING IN POOL, YOU WILL NEVER RESORT LIKE THIS
This is my second mail.  and which i expect turn a new leaf
If you dont improve,  your efforts of pooling will go unnoticed

0,"On 06/14/2016 a little after 9 am one of the drivers for Uber came down my driveway and tried to turn through my grass instead of backing out like he came and not only destroyed but landscaping, took out the water fountain but mowed down my kids' large swing set. We reached out to Uber who told my son who was in the car at the time of the accident that an adjuster would be coming out to assess the damages. We have never heard from them again. They are accountable as this is the driver they hired to drive for them and that man should not be driving anyone around. Also he could have killed my son! Something needs to be done about this!",
0,I had 6-7 free rides which I was rewarded by referring my friends. Yesterday I referred one of my friend and she received first free ride and took a ride. I received a mail stating that I have earned free ride of 125/-. I then booked a cab in Uber but when I reached my destination I was charged the whole amount. I opened the app after paying the driver and saw there was no free rides available for me whereas day before yesterday I saw 6 free rides which were not expired also. I immediately mailed to customer help and they replied that I have misused my account to get a free ride. This is ridiculous. ,
0,"I used uber when traveling to NY to see my brother James. He lives next to Jamaica station and  usually I take a cab from jfk to his place that adds up to as much as $70 for a ride. This time I decided to try uber and was very pleased with the price offered just $23. 
The driver arrived quickly and the car was neat. Overall great experience!",
0,"I've had countless issues with uber drivers claiming false cancellations, claiming to have picked me up when they hadn't, etc. Tonight a guy picked me up and immediately started hinting that I lived too far away. Mid way through the ride he finally concluded that I did,in fact, live too far away (he just wasn't familiar with the New York area at ALL- NO, Brooklyn isn't in Manhattan). He kicked me out of the car in the middle of the night in a bad neighborhood and cancelled the ride. I had to walk with my three heavy bags all the way home because of other issues with false cancellations and uber. Lyft isn't much better but fewer terrible experiences for sure.",
0,"Too much words are needed to explain about this big scam ,whether you are a driver or a rider.  I have experienced both sides. Uner is collecting your information and selling them and ripping off the driver and the rider both!  Stay away from this evil at any cost !",
0,"First, I requested an Uber driver that was 6 minutes away from me in an appropriate amount of time before I needed to get to my destination. I needed to be at the airport by 8:30 a.m. and contacted Uber at 7:40. I didn't want to have to pay for parking at the airport. When I requested the Uber driver I saw that he has 4 out of 5 stars and figured he would be a good driver. 
    However, the driver seemed to be lost and had no clue where he was. He passed my street four times, which my street is not that difficult to find! He kept making U-turns and turning down the wrong streets. 
   For a driver, you're suppose to know where you're going! And if you don't know, follow the GPS! It was an awful experience that I had with Uber. I had to pay an outrageous price for parking at the airport and was late for my flight! If the driver just knew where he was going or knew how to use a GPS then this issue wouldn't be an issue!
    Since I canceled the Uber ride they want to charge me for a cancelation fee! Uber really needs to test their drivers to see if they're smart enough to use a GPS. Although, you'd think it would be common knowledge... I guess not.",
0,"I called Uber this morning to schedule a pick-up. When the driver arrived, the name on his I.D. was different from the name given me during scheduling. He said he needed to have payment in cash ($8.00). As I was going to be late for a doctor's visit, I paid him the cash. Uber then charged my bank account for the fare. I have tried to reach Uber numerous times, numerous ways, with no response. A customer service phone number instructs me to contact them online. Their website suggests I sign-in to report an issue, but when I hit the button to do so, I get a note that says ""Page Not Found"". Horrible, unreliable service and drivers... too good to be true.",
1,"On April 9, 2016 at 1:00 am I requested a car from lower Manhattan to Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn which is a long ride. I watched as the map showed the car getting closer and only 1 minute away. I waited for another 10 minutes but the driver never showed. Then the driver canceled the ride. I tried again and another car was coming and never showed. Also the app showed the driver around the corner a minute away. After 10 more minutes I canceled. My friend who was with me requested a car from lower Manhattan to the Upper East Side in Manhattan and guess what, the driver showed. Uber charged me two cancellation fees and I had to take the subway at 1:30 am for an hour and a half to Brooklyn.",
0,"Uber drivers are not held to the same standards as cab drivers.  They often cancel your ride and the company will put the charge onto your credit card. I have been trying to get 2 of those charges off of my card now for months with no resolution, having sent at least 8 emails to numerous individuals. It seems like you can never connect with the same person to solve your problem and there is absolutely no way to make contact by phone. I also tried to get an Uber out of the country and the guy just never showed. Another driver had no idea how to get to the airport that was 15 minutes away and took a route that took over an hour and I was almost late for my flight.  Be wary travelers!",
0,"I have noticed in the past months a serious decline in Uber service. Drivers are incredibly unprofessional. For example, today I was late to work so I requested an Uber. A driver accepted my request and the app showed he was just 3 minutes away. As I am waiting, I see the car move away from my location instead of closer. I call the driver, who tells me he is coming around. After waiting another 8 minutes, and seeing he is indeed coming around, he suddenly- and for no reason - cancels the trip when he is just a half block away. ",
1,Noticed activity on my iPhone today saying that my Uber ride was en route - well that was interesting as I was working from home and had not called Uber so I cancelled it without thinking anything was wrong. Went to drive my car to yoga and a new message comes up about my Uber driver is en route! Now I am curious so I go into my account and see that there were several rides since midnight - one for nearly $500. the interesting part was they were in Detroit and I am in Atlanta and had not been to Detroit in over six months and I always rent a car when there. In any case I send a message that I think there has been fraudulent activity and briefly explain what is going on - no response nothing! So I call the driver that is supposedly picking me up and tell him that I am in ATL that this is a fraudulent ride - he hangs up on me. ,
1,"I was at the airport and figured I would try Uber ..first guy ..we went around in circles 
Trying to navigate the map.. I don't
Know where I am at the airport they say you can contact the driver or text I couldn't
Second driver same thing ..you would think one of them would call me they could see I was still standing lost ..never ever again at least real cab drivers call you and let you know where to go and where they can meet you.. I hope they do not charge
Me doe those two cancelations that would be the icing on the cake.. Uber you suck

0,"A few week ago my boyfriend had ordered me an uber ride home. It was very late, and when I had gotten in the cab, the driver seemed really aloof and tired. I was very courteous, asked him how his night was, and the response I got was very groggy and rude. Regardless he started driving and when he hit over 50mph in a 25mph school zone, I started getting a bit uncomfortable and concerned. I asked politely if he could slow down and again, he answered with a rude tone of voice.
A few days go by and I get a call from my boyfriend asking why he was charged $165.00 !!!!! The driver had accused me of vomiting in his car!!! And took ""fake photos"" and sent them to uber! It was appalling! And the photos he took looked like a crime seen it was so disgusting. It looked liked mushy popcorn and water, and the guy even went so far to smear it all over his car. Was just so gross. 
Never in my life have I thrown up in someone's taxi cab, and if I had felt sick, I would have politely told the man to pull over. I was not sick, I was not drunk, and I remember the ride clearly. Nothing along those lines had happened and I am shocked uber let him get away with something so terrible. Not only did he accuse an innocent passanger, but tried to steal money from my boyfriends account. TERRIBLE!!!!!",
0,"Uber did not get my payment because the credit card was outdated. I would like to solve the matter but have not been able to do this on line. I am not going to spend 10 hours on line trying to figure this out since I am not that technical. A number to reach Uber would be nice.
The only reason I gave 3 stars was because the driver was great. Customer service??????????...There is absolutely no customer service!!!..really..none! You will never ever be able to speak to anyone. If your question is not in their category of FAQ's then forget it. So how does that make you feel as a customer?  Sounds to me like they don't want to talk to the people who are making their business grow. They are now on my do not call list.",
0,"This past Friday, May 13, 2016 at 4:40 p.m., I wanted to try the new UBER app to order a car. It was raining and I am disabled. I followed all the instructions on the APP 1. pickup location 224 West 57 Street & Broadway 2) destination, Sheepshead Bay Brooklyn. etc. and they sent me the name of the driver and you can see how far away he is from your location. I was waiting for the price of the ride which I thought should be automatically; some kind of confirmation number so I can have the option to not accept the car. The driver came and I figured he would know, as soon as I told him where I had to go, he was complaining that the trip was too far, a lot of traffic for Friday and it is raining. I asked him how much is the ride. He had no idea, but he kept saying to me it is an estimated price. There is no set price. That was not what I expected, so I asked what will the estimate be he said up to $200.00 due to the rain, heavy traffic. ",
0,"I took a 13.00 fare to pick up a car for my company. I had all of my stuff, which included 2 phones. As soon as the driver left I realized I forgot 1 of the phones which I with android device manager while emailing both he and Uber support 7 times each over the course of the next hour. The driver answered his phone once and obviously knew I was calling about my phone as the Uber automated system tells him that when it auto calls. He hung up and then did not answer again for another hour. Uber responded back with ""wait a while"". After the hour of trying I texted and left a VM that simply said, ""I know you have my phone because I can see it on GPS, please call me back."" Well this moron obviously is not aware of gps technology and probably figured he was caught so he called me back. The conversation was unintelligible as he repeated over and over that he wasn't in my city any longer and couldn't get right back. ",

0,"First and foremost, in India there is no customer care service from UBER. There is just a help tab through which we can raise a complaint and that will be solved after 24hrs (taking their sweet time to respond).
If a customer is in a deep trouble there is nobody to help. That pathetic ""HELP"" doesn't help actually.
There were multiple issues I have faced with UBER. But, today it was disgusting. I got ill because of the $#*!ty freshener used in the cab. Apart from that driver had stopped the car in the middle, ended the trip and told me to get down at the unknown place because I was ill. And I was helpless because UBER has only ""HELP"" tab which doesn't work at all at the time of need. He denied to take me to the destination as he had some other work. when I insisted him he told I'll take you to the X place (where he had some work) and then I'll drop you to the destination. He forced me get down. I had to taxi from that place to my destination (Thanks to God I found a taxi over there), by the way I was charged for this trip which was equivalent to trip charge. Who is going to help in this.
This is not the end yet. As the driver had ended the trip I was wrongly charged (more than what it is at time of booking) whose fault it was?? Driver was rude & abusive - UBER has ""HELP"" tab for your security.
I have raised many requests on UBER ""HELP"" till now no help.
One more important thing ""TIME"", nobody cares. Because of abrupt ending of the trip I reached my destination very late. Who is responsible??
This is not the first time I was wrongly charged, it has become usual.
IRRITATED, PATHETIC, DISGUSTING",
0,"We got Uber last night literally 4 miles total. The uber driver was confused since his phone said error and he was like I have never seen that before, we asked him to stop and reset, he didn't as we pulled up to the house it said I was going from Jacksonville Florida to CA and the trip amount was over $5000. I immediately told the driver you need to fix this ASAP. He hit trip end and it showed $7.15 which is still high. I look at my bank account and Uber took out $250, I sent them a dispute and received an email back ""this email isn't associated with your account."" WHAT??? I have only one email... and proceeded to screen shot everything. I had to call my bank and dispute charges, This is still not resolved and closing my account",
1,The company is unprofessional period. They don't care about safety. The people who talk to u sound like they're automated or reading a script. They do not care about u at all.

I stated to work at Meijer on North Weber. The conversation continued. ""You need to cancel cause I am 25 minutes away.""

We waited and Hans did not show up at our hotel, but the app showed he was waiting for us at our hotel and the trip was finally cancelled by Uber and we were charged a wait fee.

1,"Our first trip on Uber (New York) was satisfactory. The driver was prompt and price was reasonable. The second trip resulted in two $5 overcharges after THEY cancelled our ride twice. Reading these reviews shows that overcharging is a common practice for Uber. We found both drivers to be pleasant and capable, and this review is not directed toward them. We will not use Uber again.",
0,Your drivers that took me to and from Canoe are either a) stupid b) lying or c) honest that you APP told them to take me MILES out of my way to and from my favorite restaurant. Drive there I was taken through Brookhaven and Buckhead AND she took me on TWO side streets to rack up the miles. Drive back? She told me your APP told her to get OFF the I85 to travel through Buckhead. I had to TELL HER directions so I would not spend the night in her car. I want a FULL refund for both trips. I was 1/2 hour late for my dinner appointment. SCAM! Check out the GPS. Unbelievable. GPS it for yourself. Should I really have to give directions and WTF on the miles?,

The worst thing is that the responses are robotic and really do not try to solve your problem. I will starting using other car service. Uber should be punished for offering such poor service.",

I couldn't believe it was so terrible. I liked the drivers and it is not their fault but I can park in a hotel garage for $10 a day and take the shuttle over.

But whenever driver did cancel, uber not pay any money because driver is cancel. I did show to rider I already cancel and I show my account cancel is $ 0.00 so not get any money from customer if I did cancel. Customer need to call uber and refund money.",

My fault - I asked the driver to drop me at the front gate of my office when Uber mapping system was showing the drop location as the back gate (Exit only). The funniest part is that to reach the back gate I had to go 1 km extra. So I was literally charged extra for saving my time, the driver's time and fuel. I understand that computers can be faulty at times. But when I contacted customer care the human (I assume) gave me the same script. What is the point of having a human out there if they don't understand logic?",

On the map you can see the drive around Buena Vista which was unnecessary. If you know Orlando, you know it's a straight shot on I 4. I drove I 4 that day and there was no construction. It took two emails to get an answer from Uber and they were all over the place with their excuses. Made no sense because it was a straight shot there and a straight shot back. I have used Uber many times but no more. I will use Lyft or go back to old fashioned taxis. How can this business survive with no real customer service?",
0,"After a night out one weekend, a friend called an Uber for me (because I was pretty drunk, and they wanted to make sure that I got home okay). While in the car, I felt like I needed to puke, so I opened the door and did so outside. NOTHING went inside the car, aside from a few small splashes on the plastic of the door. I offered to go buy a water bottle and rinse that off, the driver said that was fine, and while I waited in line at the store, he took off. Left a drunk 20-something girl on the street, not ensuring her safe arrival home. Both myself and my friend who split the fare with me were charged a small fee - UNTIL our visa statements came where we saw a $75 cleaning fee EACH on top of the ride charge. I spoke to many friends and acquaintances, some of whom actually told me that they puked inside an Uber, and were charged $50. ",
0,"Uber has overcharged $150 dollars for a bogus cleaning fee. I have communicated with them letting them know it was a mistake since we took a very short ride and no accidents happened.

There were two of us, we are in our 50's we were picked up at 11:29 pm and dropped off at 11:39 pm. The pictures are not clear, they show white particles on one side of black seat behind passenger seat. They are still insisting the charges are valid and no refund will be processed. Their time stamp on the incident report is 11:26 pm, obviously we were set up by driver. Shame on them, for what I see online this has happened a few times before.

That wasn't a problem because I needed the money. I started the trip, drove to the destination and completed the trip with 5 stars. Right after completing the rating the app logs me off, suggesting that I get back to my home location for me to be able to go back online. The app froze and there was nothing else I could do in it.

1,"I have been using the service for the past one year. Your service is very good. Recently one issue is being observed while a cab is allotted for the ride booked. While the cab is already under a trip it is being allotted for the next booking as it is en route and about to complete its last trip. But it is not the case always. On 30-apr-17, when a cab was booked from my residence, the allotted one was somewhere at about 5km away and further 5km yet to go to complete the last trip and then to reach me. ",

0,"Pre-booked a cab last night for this morning for 10 am to go to St. Michael's Hospital Toronto as have an appointment, the driver came and cancelled on us as they don't go downtown... Asked them to get us another driver which they said couldn't. Went to rebook and I have to wait for another hour which is unacceptable. On top of that they then charged a cancellation fee... Not happy???",
0,"Uber gave me an estimate of $17.68 off its app. Driver picked me up, no traffic, he didn't know where he was going, and I ended up getting charged $23.70. That's 33% higher than the estimate. Unacceptable. Next time: Lyft.",
0,"I texted UBER for a 6 minute ride and the first driver was a no show. I waited 2 hours, then called again. This time a different driver showed up but overcharged me $15.00! It was a creepy ride and UBER refused to refund my ""cancellation"" fee that I was incorrectly charged for the drives that never showed. Good luck ever reasoning with UBER. They don't care.",
1,called for uber to take us to union station from American university section of DC. initial proposed charge was  for $21 then just before pick up got message surge pricing in effect. without proposed charge. agreed since too late to reschedule with other company. pick up was at 9:47 am and there was little traffic. Charge  was $55.82. Fee for larger vehicle to accommodate handicap from Regan airport on return was $34 without tip. A longer trip. Contacted uber which was difficult and no remorse whatsoever. Will never use uber again as no trtust factor at all. Car was mediocre at best. not a accompany to be trusted under any circumstances.,
1,"Got seriously duped by Uber. Got billed $419 for a trip from Napa to Tracy, CA. Same trip two days ago was $97. They slip the so called Black service under the rug and it is not clear at all that the customer is stepping on a mine with the super high charge. They have been totally unwilling to address that matter and reach a fair arrangement. There have to be consumer protection against such misleading services that differ dramatically in pricing from their regular services.",
0,"I was a 4.9 rated driver with over 450 trips. Vehicle depreciation, being contractor, dealing with ungrateful/cheap passengers, and fuel expenses were ok to deal with until Uber spent money and lobbied to have warrant checks and fingerprinting eliminated as employment requirement in Houston. Now the market is flooded with druggies, perverts, and criminals. Uber rather have thousands of sub-par drivers than reward good drivers. This keeps the surge down and in theory more people will use the service if the prices aren't surging.",
1,"Scheduled Uber to take myself and my daughters to the airport. Yes, THE AIRPORT... They cancelled 30 mins AFTER our scheduled pick up time. YOU CANNOT DO THAT! IT'S A FLIGHT! Called a cab, came in 7 mins!",

0,"I ordered an Uber drive. Once I ordered it gave an amount that the ride would cost of $7.40. The driver got lost in my complex and it took several minutes by phone to direct her to the correct address. Uber charged me a wait fee! The driver also got lost on the way to destination, which I didn't mind at the time. But now after being charged nearly $11. for a 7.40 ride, it bothers me. They also do not mention or include an order charge of more than $2.00 in the quote that is provided. If I'm being quoted an amount then that's what I expect to be charged. I won't choose to ride with Uber in the future.",
1,I have never used UBER and never will after reading reviews and stories on the news. If enough people stop using them they will be forced to fix the problem or go out of business.,
0,"I booked uber but those drivers told that we are very far we won't come to pick you.up...they suggested me to cancel it and book it again...again the next driver told me the same... I will be simply charged due to cancellation... 
The company should check this... worst experience as I was in hurry...",
0,"I had just arrived from the airport for my trip and was super excited to begin my vacation. However, my friend and I called for an Uber...which I highly regret now...that totally switched my happy mood into pure frustration and put me into the worst mood possible...
My friend had took my phone to call for an Uber. The Uber driver was very poor at communicating his destination. After waiting around for a bit, we told him we were at the gate that he told us to be waiting for him after running there in a hurry. He was very short and rude in the manner in which he communicated. Once I told him we were in arrivals, he told us that he said to be departures and cancelled the ride, and Uber had to audacity to charge me for NO service! 
In the normal world, when people arrive at a destination from a flight, they get picked up in ""arrivals"". I tried to contact Uber, but apparently they do not have a real phone line to call customer support. Trying to get my money back was such a pain and ruined the whole start of my trip. All I wanted was my money back, and I probably would have been fine and a little irritated about the experience but probably would of still continued to use Uber if they had simply refunded me....However, they would only give me ""Uber credit"" to use on my next trip and still charged my card. I told them to remove the charge from my card, but they said that was ""against their policy"". 
I have talked with a few others that have similar situations happen to them, and they were able to get full refunds for their charged cancellation...but I don't know why refunding my card in particular was against their policy. Seems as if the company picks and chooses who they want to refund...which wouldn't qualify as a ""policy"". 
I guess they would prefer to lose a customer to a competitor than refund a simple $5 cancellation. That simple $5 costs them close to $200 in lost revenue just for that weekend with all of us using Lyft and other transportation services instead. My first Lyft ride was really great, the driver had even given us complimentary waters and protein bars and his car seats were actually cool massage chairs!
Back to the point, Uber is not a good company...there are sooo many things that are wrong with them aside from stealing money from customers. They prefer employees that are greedy and will do anything at all costs to get ahead. I'm not just referring to the drivers (some have which have been nice to me on other occasions), I'm referring to the corporate dogs that devalue everyone around them. Here is a link to an article if you would like to learn more about the toxicity of the Uber culture...

0,I requested a ride to a medical office that was 0.9 miles from where Uber picked me up. After driving a few miles I questioned if this was correct. I'm not familiar with the area and didn't know exactly where I had to be. The driver pulled into a parking lot and checked her gps and said her Uber app was incorrect. After going 8 or 9 miles I was dropped off at my destination and instructed to contact Uber for a credit. I never tried to change my destination and she always had the exact address. I was charged $20.25 for a ride that should have been 0.9 miles from where I was picked up. After several emails back and forth I am now being charged $15.67 because my ride wasn't timed properly! This is supposed to reflect my proper pick up and destination! If the driver makes a mistake or can't use equipment properly customers shouldn't have to pay for it!,
1,"they would just say ""Sorry but your account has been deactivated."" And when I emailed them again, they said they would help but that I should send them a picture of my credit card, my id, and my cellphone information in the about section. I send them that and immediately they write me again that sorry I am not allowed on Uber. Then why did they ask for my information? Are they stealing people/s info now and hacking their phone?",
1,"Uber offered me 50% off 10 rides thru July 2 however every time I request a ride they make sure to charge me half off of surge pricing no matter what time of day, whether it's busy or not. Basically half off means I am still paying the regular non surge price. What a rip off. And ploy to get money.",
1,"Their app charges toll when even their driver didn't pay the toll. At time when even the toll plaza is not there, their system charges toll. Their system is complete flaw and they just give excuse that it is designed the correct way. Please be aware when traveling in Pune by Uber. They can charge you toll when even they or their driver didn't pay it.",

I really don't know how I am charged so much & top of that the Uber driver does not have a customer care number & when I told him I would not be giving that money shown he started giving me dhamkis or it can be said that he started talking to me sternly that ""If you do not pay I would not be able to let you down."" However I gave him the money. This is very much unethical & wanted to say that I need my refund as soon as possible because I have sent innumerable mails to Uber & tried to make calls to the customer care but none of it worked out.",
1,"I purchased an Uber gift card to be able to get myself around to some very important places that I need to get to such as the doctor's office and pharmacy. Uber prints its store-bought gift cards on cheap, flimsy, unreliable paper. After purchasing my Uber gift card with 50 dollars cash (because my credit card is unavailable for use at this time) I proceeded to scratch off the covering of the code so I would be able to immediately redeem it, apply it to my account. Only when I did the numbers were unreadable, illegible, and part of the gift card paper had come off. There is no way at all for me to be able to read anything under that, it is beyond disgusting and despicable. ",

1,"The driver took ages to approach the location, didn't show up, cancelled my trip.. and then Uber charged me a cancellation fee.

I tried to dispute, but was told that the ride was complete. I replied that someone must have taken the ride, as I had cancelled. They would not refund.",
1,I requested 4 different ubers and every uber canceled on me. Uber is a joke. If you were smart you would use lift.,
1,I use to use Uber all the time until this past week I purchased a car. After I got my car I received several charges from Uber on my account. I immediately informed Uber who advised me it was indeed on another customer's account. However they have done NOTHING to try and rectify this issue. They have the worst communication system possible. No one has responded in two days and they didn't even refund me!! I will also be putting this review on BBB. UBER IS A BUNCH OF SCAM ARTISTS AND I'LL NEVER USE THEIR SERVICE AGAIN.,
1,My 13 year old child was able to independently create an account and be provided services. It is against the law and supposedly the company rules of service unaccompanied minors.

1,"I had been a customer for over 2+ years without one complaint or bad review on Uber. While traveling in Mexico I had an extremely awful experience with another customer on Uber Share to the point that the woman was irate and offending me, but Uber decided to cancel my service without even once hearing my side of the story!!!! I contact them numerous times via email until after the 3rd attempt I finally received a pathetic email stating I am no longer a customer. They stated they opened an investigation, but yet will not share any information! If this is how they treat their customers, I definitely prefer to utilize Lyft. User beware of Uber and their horrible customer service. Don't expect them to even hear your side of the story! No wonder they are plastered negatively all over the news for good reason!",
0,"My husband and I were visiting New York City. We used the Metro and buses most of the trip, but we were going to Carnegie Hall for a concert in the rain. We didn't want to get wet, so we requested an Uber for the first time. We waited where we were told, on the sidewalk, in the rain, with time to spare. When the Uber driver texted that he was there, we didn't see his car at all. We tried waving at people, but we didn't see them and no one stopped. Then, the drive was cancelled by the driver. So, we waited another at least ten minutes for another driver, which ended up getting us there. The next day, I was emailed that we were charged a $5 cancellation fee for the first ride we never took. My big problem is that when I contacted Uber, they did not understand and didn't do anything to fix it. I did not cancel the ride, and we were standing where we we're supposed to. I won't be using Uber again.",
0,Poor driving and texting / address look up while driving and getting into accidents with no care for others,
0,Totally unprofessional driver - First when he did not pull up to location he waited across the street from the location. So my son and I had to walk across. NO problem. When we get to destination my hotel was across the street I asked him to make a U-turn and drop me in front of my location. He told me he wanted to go straight so he wasn't making U-turn. He said he would have to go around the block. I said fine with me. I told him I was going to report him. He then sped up the car to the middle of next block and told me and my child to get out and I did leave without incident.,
1,"On June 11, 2017, my wife and I attended a Dave Matthews concert in Chicago. Afterward, we were directed by staff security to walk to Michigan Ave. adjacent to the Museum/Aquarium/Planetarium campus to acquire a ride back to our condo as only vehicles leaving the campus would be allowed on the campus roadways. We called for an Uber at 11:06 pm and it was confirmed. We were standing in front of a condo called 1130 - address 1130 S. Michigan Ave. The Uber confirmation indicated our pickup spot would be 1131 S. Michigan Ave. Since there is only a park/greenspace opposite 1130 S. Michigan Ave. we figured the pickup address meant...We had to cross the street! Not an easy thing to do -- Michigan Ave. is 8 lanes wide and BUSY, as you can imagine after a concert with 30,000+ people.",
1,"I placed an order on Uber Eats app. Less than a second after I placed the order I noticed I had order 3 subs instead of one and I wanted to remove two of those subs and keep only one along with the other stuff I had also ordered. When I call customer service they are telling me that nothing can be changed or canceled because the order was already prepared. In less than a minute from placing the order and calling they had prepared the sub. Yeah right. So pretty much I'm forced to pay for 2 subs I didn't want. And in the Uber app it gives option to cancel or change your order but when you call they tell you no you can't, so I see it as false advertising.",
1,"Uber has a program called Ride Pass that they have rolled out to a lot of Philadelphians. In exchange of a $20 fee, the user would receive UberPool rides at a flat fee of $2.99 and UberX rides at a flat rate of $5.99 within a designated area for a total of 28 days. The only stipulation, is that if the full value of the ride exceeds $20, the rider must pay the overage. (i.e. if a pool ride costs $24, the user would be charged $6.99). Easy right?",
0,"I purchased an Uber Smart Pass a week ago and I've noticed several lies within their promotion. When I first purchased it, the app told me that anything under $30 would be covered within the Smart Pass range. Now that verbiage has changed to $20. Also, since purchasing the Smart Pass, Uber drivers have been canceling rides left and right. I've had drivers arrive AT MY APT. and cancel the ride for no real reason. The most annoying part is being charged $5 each time. I can't comprehend why the service charges YOU whenever the driver cancels. That's insane. Charge the drivers for being inept or money hungry for a ""better ride"". Don't punished your loyal customers.",
0,"I wrote to Uber, ""Your previous drunk driver crashes the car far away from my destination and you still charge me. He leaves me in the middle of nowhere.

And trying to get it straightened out, so called customer service kept sending me a form letters  that had nothing to do with my complaint. In my opinion Uber is a scam. Yes you can get where you're going but they charge you at least 20% more then they state their charging.  One time, they charge me three times what they stated they would be charging. It took in excess of 75 emails from me to get that straightened out. Don't waste your money, don't waste your time. Uber stinks",

1,"I use Uber in China, Australia, India and UK and have found them to be reasonable up until now. I took an Uber in Brisbane recently and the driver was terrible. My female companion complained to the driver about his erratic unsafe driving in general, his ignoring of the navigator, ignoring of directions. Uber driver, knowing he would get a one star rating, then complained about us both making 'racist' remarks. I have no idea of what nationality the driver was, it was not even on my radar. My companion sits on University Boards and other Government agencies and is listed in top women business leaders, I also am on similar boards, travel extensively through Asia, Europe and India, we both have no racist comments to make, but we are immediately, according to Uber, guilty. Uber suspends account without discussion with me and then after only sending condescending patronizing emails 'about their community' as they are now also the new warrior and standard setter of community political correctness and protector of multiculturalism, supposedly 'unblocks' my account but it will not work. Despite trying several times to contact them to resolve,  emails are answered, one of our team will be in touch, still waiting. Uber's arrogance knows no bounds, they answer to no one but themselves, they are not only condescending in their attitude, they make public claims which they do not back up.   As they have to answer to know one except their own falsely manufactured 'community' which standards are set by a mutli-national based on profits, not moral or a code of conduct that has checks and balances denying a process for right of reasonable reply nor natural justice to their passengers. Their complaint service is purposefully designed to avoid human contact so they can make their morally one sided incoherent biased judgement in complete isolation and then make unfounded derogatory unable to be replied to judgments that if I knew who it was I would complain to the HRC. As they have no responsibility to local authority nor reasonable codes of contact and conduct, do not expect a fair go from Uber and do your best to out them as a self serving corporate usurer of community standards for their own profit motive while making false claims against real people of high standing in real communities, expose them for the hypocrites they are.

1,"Uber mentions standard upfront charges for their pool rides but if the person you are pooling with cancels the ride, Uber will introduce dynamic charges and charge that extra amount to you. And i guess they even charge the person who cancels. So in a way Uber is making 2 way money. They charged me 3 times the normal charge for a ride where another pooler cancelled the ride. And now they are fooling me saying that since the distance travelled was more than what was entered originally they are charging me more. But actually distance increased because the driver had to pick up another pooler. Now this person didn't turn up. So entire money load comes on me.",
1,"Last night, I received a text from Uber stating that the email address on my Uber account was changed. Since then, I have not been able to log into my account. The hacker also changed the password. Everywhere I look, it all comes back to having the correct email address on the account. I have tried contacting Uber to resolve this problem - there is no phone number and the given email address does not accept incoming messages.

0,I am a driver for Uber and noticed I am getting shorted on my pay. I was sent 5 miles to get a rider for a 2 mile ride. Made $2.74. Uber charged the rider $5.96.  Uber took $2.30 for themselves then gave me 75% which made my real pay 46%. Uber cheats their drivers. On the 500 plus rides I've given they have probably cheated me out of a few thousand dollars and customer service is a JOKE!! WORSE THAN Comcast.,

This walk is 30 mins from the train station with some area with no sidewalks. I make a stop at the store half way home. I get home plug up my phone, check the email and see a receipt from Uber. They charged me for the ride as if the driver reported that he picked me up and dropped me to my destination which didn't happened. I walked 30 mins to my front door.

The driver did not answer his phone and after continuous tries he Dramane finally picked up after about 15 minutes of me calling nonstop. I asked him to please look in the back of his car for my phone. He told me ""I have a client and can't"". Bullcrap. He should have done so immediately and from his responses to me I could tell that he was acting very shady. I have no doubt that he did find my phone and kept it. Which means HE STOLE MY CELL PHONE AND UBER DID NOTHING TO HELP ME. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL.",
1,"Recently use UBER to and from NY La Guardia Airport from my home in Riverdale, NY.  The fare was $17.00 higher on the return trip than going to the airport.  When I complained to UBEr, I was told that 'surge pricing"" applied to my return trip.  Surge pricing is in effect during periods of high demand, high or heavy traffic,or bad weather.  None of these conditions applied.  In fact, we asked the driver upon pick up if it was particularly busy, and he confirmed clearly, it was not;  in fact he said it was extremely LIGHT.  There was absolutely no traffic on the trip from the airport to my home.   Conversely, on the trip TO the airport three days earlier, when my fare was $17.00 LOWER, the driver said traffic was extremely heavy and she took an alternate route to save time.  
I firmly belive UBER also uses their ""SURGE PRICING"" as a means to increase revenue during normally quiet times, forcing customers to pay higher fares in order to make up for fewer rides requested.  I find this very disturbing and unethical.  Finally, in UBER's response to my complaint, I was told that the fare was displayed before I accepted the ride.  And while this is true, I needed a ride home and price gouging is improper and unethical in any situation.  I am looking into other ride APPS, and will avoid UBER in the future.",
1,"My Uber account was locked because Uber claims that I have outstanding charges on my account. At this moment, I have 5 supposed outstanding balances on my account from Ubereats. I say that it is supposed because I was charged for all 5 transactions and the money has been taken out from my bank account and paid for. I have been emailing back and forth to Uber about this, but every time it is always someone different replying to me and it is as though they do not even read the previous replies. All they keep telling me is that the charges are legitimate. The first time they told me it is legitimate, then I relied and told them that I was charged and I have my bank statement to prove it, then the next person tells me that it looks as though the charges were disputed and refunded to me, then the next person tells me the charges are legitimate and does not read the previous emails.

And to make matters worse, it was my birthday and it was ON THE WAY to the restaurant with my wife. There was no damage or anything that we did to be charged this. AND THEY DON'T HAVE A PHONE NUMBER so I have to email them and they have yet to respond and it's been HOURS since I sent the email. I do NOT recommend this company as they are a scam.

0,I have had so many negative encounters with Uber is not even funny. They took out money from my account several times for trips I didn't take. I used to use them to get to my job and there was always something with them. My last experience I had order an Uber to get to my job. They took the money out of my account. I saw in the map that the driver was taking the trip without me when I had 7mins outside waiting. I called the driver and she hang up the phone. I had to take the bus to work and I was late. Last but not least I got a warning in my job for being an hour late. There was another time they took $88 dollars out of my account for going to NY paying two tolls. When I only took an Uber to my job. I'm done with them. I deleted the app and never again. Lesson learned.,
1,Uber first tried to charge me for 2 incorrect rides that I did not take. When I disputed with my credit card company- Wells Fargo - they ONLY removed the rides I did not take. Uber is stating I did not pay for the 2 rides I did take. I sent proof of screen shots from wells fargo site and even spoke to wells 2 times where they say I did pay and it was not retracted. You cannot call Uber and speak to someone. They just keep replying back that I did not pay. I cannot even book another ride.,

When I contacted Uber customer support, the computer generated response stated that the fare was correct and refund would be given. When I replied with the attached supporting screenshots of the quoted fare and actual fare charged, I received the same generic information with no mention of the supporting evidence that was included submitted.",
1,"WARNING: Take a screenshot of the fare you are agreeing with Uber to charge you, you may need it when they change the fare later. Uber increased their agreed to fare with me after the trip was in progress. When asked about it they denied it.

Fact is he did take the most efficient route possible as if that would give them a reason for raising their already agree to fare anyway. I can not trust them and will not give them another chance so you need to know this happens.",
1,"DO not drive for uber eats as this company has no value for any of it so called Partners. YOu will end up paying uber to drive for them and no profits. in addition you will be stress out because they also want to rate you for a rating system that you have no control over. I started driving for uber because i was recently laid off and needed some income. Like many before me i, fell prey to their deceiving craiglist advertising that  tell you that you could make up to 30 dollars and hour and that it was a fun no boss way to make money. DIN""T even come close to making minimum wage and in addition at the end of the year when i file taxes was told that i owed 1500. dollars. for taxes. SO after taxes, oil change, Gasoline, tires, and i ended up with nothing. I also tried their UBer eats was far more worse. I was waiting for over two hours to get a precious beep and after getting beep went up four set of stairs and customers don't even give you any tip. delivery fee was only 2.30 cents so after two hours. THis is what i made. In addition i did twenty hours for uber eats and made after gasoline 100. dollars far less than the minimum wage. DO NOT GET Deceived by their false adds to be your own boss and make as much. They control everything, from rating, to how many beeps, you get to tipping option which they still haven't added to their app. DO YOUSELVES  a favor stay away from UBER EATS.",
1,Uber did not record a trip I made as a driver. I reached out to them with specifics of the trip I completed and they basically said if I didn't have exact records of the trip they couldn't prove I made the trip and didn't provide me with an explanation as to what could've happened or who I could reach out to to file a complaint. I signed up with Uber because I thought it would be convenient not to drive people around for free. Very disappointed. If you choose to drive with Uber be sure to screenshot or document your trips because if your money goes missing they will not help you!,
0,Most of my Uber experiences have been good except....driver cancels and then there is a price surge.  Yesterday I was quoted 23 dollars and then the driver took his own crazy route and the bill is 38 dollars.  I also got ripped off when a driver went the wrong way.  Is this normal?,
0,"First, my complaint is Uber REFUSES to call anyone so you can have a conversation about your dissatisfaction. Second my complaint is that they are running a bait and switch that is unethical. My TRIP: THE ISSUE is that their app told me I could USE UberX for a trip from the Indianapolis airport to my house in Cincinnati and the fee would be $115. I checked it 3 different time during the week to confirm the rate wasn't a error. When I got to the Indy airport from FL I checked it again and the app said my cost would be $115. WHEN the driver showed up tells me that I can't use UberX but had to select UberXL because of the distance of the trip.",
1,My name is Scott and my husband was working for Uber. He had a ride with 3 people in it. When they got in they had a metal smoking pipe that they put out on the hood liner of my car. The pipe was left in the car and a burn hole in my car. He sent pictures to Uber and they said that they needed a quote. So the first quote we got was almost $2000 from Chrysler since that's my car. We only received the quote over the phone. It was too far away to drive so we called Chrysler near us. They referred us to a person that gave us a quote of about $300. He sent the quote to Uber and they got back to him today.,

0,"I'll start by stating in New York uber has the most laziest drivers, more lazy and un- compromising than average crappy cab service. In my experience drivers refuse to contact their customers, they lack any ounce of hospitably, Ive seen cabs on my map literally pass right by me, are too lazy to find me or even make a U-turn. Despite the address I input some drivers will get lazy and drop me off at the wrong spot or a block away from my stop. Some drivers are either to old, lazy or stupid to know how GPS works, which cause locations errors most driver do not want to make up for, for a lot of errors drivers make I ""the customer"" have to compensate for. Uber's refund system is a joke! If a driver cancel a trip the cancel fee comes out of my pocket! And when I report it they give me credit (not an issue) but I want my real money they toke back! Their rating system is adorably useless, because regardless how many one stars a driver gets whats the point if you can't report the driver on their $#*!ty service or better, make a complaint, I've seen drivers that treat me like crap with five or four stars!?. I'm from NY and a lot of drivers are not American therefore theres a big broken English barrier, try explaining a location to someone who doesn't understand you or vice versa. The only reason I ever use uber is literally because Lyft has error issues on my phone, Lyft is also cheaper with nicer drivers, while uber is the Kwik-E-Mart of cab services. Ubers only good for drunk or lazy riders who don't understand good customer service.",
1,"My Uber Account was hacked today. Uber does not have a customer service line that you can contact. I was unable to log into my account to remove my payment information due to the hacker changing the email and password onto my account. Uber's site says to send them an email and someone will contact me within 24 hours. That's not acceptable. I've had to cancel my credit cards right before Memorial Day Weekend which doesn't make for a pleasant holiday. Thanks, Uber, for your ZERO customer service. I just want everyone to know that there is NO one to call if this happens to you.",
0,I always had a good drive with the uber. But today morning I have my exam from 9. I call the uber driver before 35 mint so that I can reach early.. And he revived my call and told me he will  reach within 5mint I waited for him for 20 mint and the driver didnot turned up and I literally missed my exam.. please select some professional driver or else it will be a great loss for the Uber company.. (*******824) this driver should need to learn a lesson.,
0,"I am wondering if all the Uber drivers are given the ability to actually fire clients... making it so that they and their families can no longer use the Uber service and on top of that... rob that person of $50? There were 2 cancellations on this evening both by the same driver in the same hour. On this night my 18 year old son (who had struggled from kidney failure since birth and whose growth was somewhat stunted) was hanging out with friend at the ""sci fi factory"" near Keller TX was ready to walk the 1.5 miles home when I told him just to wait and I'd get him an Uber. The Uber driver pulled up... took one look at my son and screamed ""you have to be 18 to ride!"" Then he pulled away leaving my son standing there. Never asked for ID... never even gave me a call! ",
1,"I spent over an hour of my personal time seeking the lowest fare to the airport following meetings in Grand Rapids, MI. I'm a government employee, and every dollar counts. Out of over 30 options reviewed, UBER was by far the cheapest at $16 from downtown. Next best was $20, and then the others hovered around $35-45. Google revealed the secret technique on how to preorder a 5:15am Uber the night before.
Out of the shower I spy a circa 5:15am. text that, due to SURGE PRICING, my 5:25am fare would now be 3.5x what we had agreed to the previous evening, and I had 5 minutes (already spent in the shower) I could cancel without being charged a fee. The soonest cab ($40 fare) was 20 minutes away that I couldn't spare at this point. My $16 deal now cost $51. Cancelling Uber at this point would mean a missed flight, lost connections and expensive misery. There was nothing to do but pay whatever they asked. Sort of like breaking down in the middle of nowhere with the only mechanic being the crooked Sheriff's brother. Well played Uber! Well played! I can't help but think this is a frequently used well-planned scenario or else they would have made me aware of this surge thing the night before being a possibility.  Had they done so, I would have used a stable priced cab service. I shall never use Uber again. They not only screwed me, but all the transportation providers that were cheaper than $50. I also am left with a bitter taste of my Grand Rapids experience although everything else during my visit was superb. I will never recommend Uber to a friend or worst enemy. NONE OF THIS HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH MY DRIVER. She was great.",
1,"This is a reasonable service.  However, they intentionally DO NOT have a way to reach the service or the driver.  As a result if you've forgotten something you're out of luck.  For example, my dealer uses Uber.  The driver was quick and efficient.  As I got out of the car and thanked him, he drove way.  No problems,  but just then I patted myself down and realized by bluetooth  (with charger) had fallen from by pocket.  I could see him driving down the hill but he did not see me.  I quickly asked the service manager to call the Uber driver (thinking I could catch him before he turned onto the main road.  NOPE!  We don't know how, after 45 minutes of keystone copism I have an email to a Brittany.  No phone number and then after much research if find out there is NO phone number, intentionally.  So, while I tried the ""contact us"" mode that didn't work.  and it turns out Uber is satisfied with not hearing from it's customer in the event they REALLY need to be reached.  Caveat Emptor!",
0,"I noticed that the reviews for Uber were low on this site so I felt compelled to share my positive experiences with readers. My husband has been using Uber for quite some time because he does a lot of traveling with his occupation. We used Uber together on our trip to San Juan Puerto Rico recently and every ride was 5 star and top notch. The drivers were friendly and professional. All of the vehicles we rode in smelled fresh and clean. We actually had a taxi driver harass one of our drivers and although we had our Uber driver pick us up at the business next door to our hotel, the taxi driver could tell it was Uber because my husband had his phone in his hand & we waved to the Uber driver. I can honestly say that due to the taxi driver scaring me by bullying our driver, I will NEVER take a taxi again as long as I live. Last I checked, we live in a capitalist society and competition is good for us. Taxis should not have a monopoly! I highly recommend Uber.",
1,Uber gives men a chance to cheat on there girlfriends or wife's. I've had it happen to me and know other women it's happened to. The guy would say I'm doing uber but really he's going to meet another women. So be care other women out that you boyfriend or husband is really doing uber and not out cheating on you. I think uber is ruining lives and destroying relationships. I think uber should be a schedule hours and should be online so many hours before getting paid or something to ensure men won't cheat.,
1,"I started driving for Uber because of the referral bonus. Figured why not drive and I get 300 dollars and my friend who referred me get 300 dollars. Fast forward me completing the 40 drives they tell you to make in a month, in a week and they say that, ""We didn't mean the money was a bonus on top of the money you made. We meant that you were guaranteed to make 300 dollars giving 40 rides."" Of course I was. That's no incentive. Lyft pays out the 300 dollars the moment you complete the trip. I complained about this stating I do not want to work for a company with such bait and switch practices and instead of resolving the situation they deleted my driver app and my rider app and didn't even let me cash out the 100 dollars I made that day.",

I called my bank and closed my check account!!!",
1,"I just want to highlight the inconvenience that has been provided by your company app to my friend: Apoorva **, her account has been blocked since a week now and we both have been trying to get in touch with your company via email and all we get in reply is that your system raised a flag and blocked us. Lol. ""FLAG just because we were updating email address."" And you want us to also ""Appreciate your understanding in this regard."" - LOL. We have all our invoices blocked in that account. Hence it's a request if someone with some logical sense can have a look at her account and get it sorted for her. Systems can do errors, but who accepts their mistakes these days. All we want is our invoices and we will make sure never to bother Uber again for any ride. Ola is way more better with respect to quality app. ",
0,"Why do you continue to overcharge rides and call it a cancellation fee. I never moved from my original site. Uber driver stopped several blocks away, then turned around and left and stuck me with a $5 cancellation fee. He cancelled me, not me cancelling him.",
1,I use my corporate card for business trips when I use Uber. My company told me I have a charge for $3.80 that I need to show proof for so I went to my Uber app and seen that I never took a trip on that date. I reached out to Uber and explained to them that I was charged but never took a ride. The first response was someone telling me to send my bank statement and they will be happy to reverse the charges. I asked my job to provide proof as I don't get statements because it's my corporate cards.,
1,"We ordered Uber XL for our party of five. A Toyota 4Runner was assigned. It did not have seating for five plus a driver. We had to cram four in the backseat. Several emails between Uber and myself resulted in a ""too bad, it's what you ordered."" So we paid premium rate for a service we did not get. Uber XL says parties of 1-6, but beware. You are responsible for knowing if the vehicle assigned will seat the number in your party.",

I usually call them after 5 minutes, most of the time they are on their way and I wait. I have had some whose phone goes to voice mail and I waited a few more minutes they come or they don't so I cancel. Uber drivers do not get paid if they wait after 5 min and the rider cancels which has happened to me, which pissed me off, especially when it is a long trip. Riders need to be outside on time or call the Uber driver. I have never canceled due to a destination, but better yet, who wants to maybe drive as I did a long distance and upon arriving have the rider cancel and don't get paid. No excuse.",
0,"I recently booked a Uber and I had to catch a train. The driver agreed to come and I continuously called him and directed my location. After 30 mins waiting for him, he cancelled.

Uber is the worst experience I had and this continues to happen every time I ride with them.",
1,"My family recently visited NYC and my dad has had great luck using Uber in other cities in the past, so when we couldn't get a cab easily, we took Uber quite a few times over our 3 day trip. Some trips were great, some were just okay, but one of them was beyond bad. We were traveling from near Times Square to Battery Park (we had reservations to be on Ellis Island at a specific time). We selected Battery Park as our drop off point, and told it to our driver again when we got in the car (the dirty, smelly car).",
1,"Driving for Uber is simultaneously good and bad. Pay is constantly fluctuating. Very unstable. $600 one week, $350 another week working same hours. They let anyone be a driver so there are more drivers now then there are rides available. Very incompetent system no way of contacting support except email or from app by selecting specific problem and even then they respond with an automated message based on problem. They do not help with maintenance or gas. A few cents off their gas credit card. Big whoop still spending $80-$100 a week on gas to drive full time and 6,000+ miles a month. And the service is way too cheap a measly 65 cents a mile and 11 cents a minute in my area with customer always wanting to make extra stops and screwing me out of my time. And they encourage people not to tip. Even for Uber eats I wait in long line and bring food to your door for $4 and no tip? Waste of time and destroys your car. Only good to make extra spending money not full time. Not to mention some customers are petty and will leave bad ratings for something like dirt on the floor. Ok 10 other people were in my car today how would I not have dirt, part of which is from you? I have time to vacuum after every ride? They expect so much out of a taxi service. Even had people complain that I didnt have the wireless Aux for their iphone 7 are you serious?",
1,"After reading reviews by other disgruntled customers, I can see that my experience is unfortunately normal. 
I arrived at Manchester, UK airport around 10:30 pm and used the app to contact a driver. The app showed the driver was 3-5 minutes away but I waited 20 minutes before receiving a message that the ride was cancelled. Part of the problem was the waiting area was not clearly indicated and local police were not allowing cars to park so it wasn't easy to be met. However, I didn't receive a call and when I tried calling I didn't get an answer. 
I didn't give up and tried twice more since by midnight there were fewer cars but it didn't help. On one of the ride requests I cancelled within 5 minutes. Now back at home I see that Uber charged me $5 US for each cancelled ride, even the one I legitimately cancelled.
I'm glad there's a forum like this to lodge a complaint but would prefer the message reached a wider audience since I now have read that Uber was given an F by the Better Business Bureau. The public should know they are scam artists !",
0,"The driver pulled up and said they were cancelling my ride to the airport. The next driver informed me that they probably had a higher fare at the last minute as my fare was only $6.00. I then get charged a $5 fee? I asked for a refund to my card, but all I received was template responses stating that they will only issue a credit to my account and cannot refund to my card. I cancelled my Uber account and my wife and daughter did as well. Hope you enjoy the $5.00, Uber!",

1,"I am very frustrated with Uber. 2 days I missed my bus because of Uber and their foolishness beyond my control and I want my money back. I am dissatisfied with not being able to talk to 1 person instead of 3 and 4 different people by email through the Uber app. Ridiculous!!!! This all started last Friday 5/5, I requested Uber at 6:28, my Uber took a few min. but Pineda came at a reasonable time. My stop is 5-6 min. from my house but the stupid Uber app told the driver to go in the opposite direction to get the other rider 15 min away and therefore made me miss my 7 am bus. So I then had to take another Uber because the next bus was 7:35 and that would have made me even later for work. Not only that but I have taken this ride several times and it cost $6, why was I charged $9.30. The receipt even says $6.26. So now I have to request another Uber to get me to the train. That was another charge but it looks like they took care of that one from Friday. ",
1,"I decided to try Uber Express Pool after work because of its advertised lower fares. I scheduled for an Uber Express Pool on Monday at 4:56 pm - 5:01 pm with a fare for $3.75, which is pretty decent. I had no issues. Because it went so well, I decided to schedule an Uber Express Pool again after work on Tuesday for the same time, 4:56 pm - 5:01 pm. Surprisingly, it was the same price, $3.75.

The same thing happened to me on 5/1 (UberX instead of Pool), however I believed it was my mistake and did not say anything. Yesterday, however I was very careful. The difference between Pool and UberX is significant and I am frustrated that I have paid so much extra, for no fault of my own. What is worse is that when I wrote to Uber Support, I was given a generic reply where they had not even attempted to fill in the automated blanks, and they would not respond to my messages.",
1,"I booked an UBER x car from Grand Central to Bed-Stuy and was quoted about $23. Driver was on his way and I got a text that said the fare changed due to increased demand. There was no other information on the app on the fare increase. I texted the driver and asked how much the surge was. He texted ""2.2"" which I thought was $2.20 or about 10%. I got a receipt for $67.00!!! Or 2.2 TIMES the fare. Numerous emails late and they only want to give a ""Courtesy credit"" of $18, still paid $50 for the fair quotes at $23.",
1,"I ordered a ride to get to work, the ETA said 15 minutes. The driver showed up in 8, and while usually that would be seen as a positive thing, I was not ready to leave yet since I thought I had 7 more minutes. Uber has a feature where the driver cancel the trip 5 minutes after arriving at the destination and it automatically charges the customer $5 even though no service was provided. This happened to me all within the 15 minute time frame I originally agreed upon with the initial Uber request. It's only $5, but it's a matter of principle. On top of this, their customer service is nearly non-existent as they don't even have a phone number to discuss this with anyone. You can only correspond through email which is very impersonal and a massive hassle. I cannot believe how shady they came across with this. ",

At the beginning everthing was fine and I thought it was a great service but sadly I was proven wrong! As I wanted to go from Meddelin city colombia to the airport to take my flight to panama city, panama... I used the Uber App for the transfer and the price that was shown to me on the App was approx. $25. It was $5 more than what I've paid for a normal Taxi coming from the airport to Medellin city but I was in hurry so I took the offer. After I've arrived at the airport though I've noticed that $45 were booked from my cc by Uber for this ride, so I did what everyone would normally do and that is send a complaint to Uber about the overcharge. I did this using the Uber app. Anyhow two days later I've received an email from Uber and I couldn't believe what they wrote to me.""Your account has been permanently suspended"". So they have suspended my account permanently for sending a complaint via their App. Can anybody believe this? Well after seeing what United Airlines did to one of it's customers nothing should shock us anymore! But all I want to say here is.. we all need to always look for and use alternatives. These big companies need to have as much competition as possible otherwise they will grow arrogant and start treating their customers like trash.",

From my point of view, customer should have a chance to rate a driver as it can be useful for other customers while selecting a cab...

1,"I am attempting to become an Uber driver. When trying to update my profile, I get a message ""please wait"" with the spinning circle and it never connects on three different computers. I called several times on two separate numbers, left messages asking them to call and they never did. Uber website is also not very intuitive or friendly.
I am also working on Lyft, so far so good, their website works, at least. At this point I say stay away from Uber.",
0,"So I am away in Vegas and I called an Uber for my daughter in Los Angeles to pick her up at school and take her home. I've done this tons of times with Uber. The school 10 minutes or 3 miles away. It is straight down the street. So I see a charge for 12 dollars and I look and I see the Uber driver picked up my daughter, drove past my house and took her 20 minutes out of the way and then took her back home. So I say that has to be a mistake. I dispute it. No way a 10 minutes ride is more than 10 dollars and I picked a Uberpool so no more than 6. The driver picks up a second person DOWN THE STREET FROM MY HOUSE and goes and gets on the freeway. My daughter let him know he's going in the wrong direction and he still take the second person home and then bring her back. Making a 10 minute ride 30 minutes.",
1,"Multiple experiences with Uber India via email has convinced me that their staff's competence, training level provided to them by Uber India and their internal group who frames processes for non US countries SUCK BIG TIME. I have used them in the US sparingly mostly to & from airport trips. Never had an issue with promptness, billing and quality of ride. Ride quality - one expects clean vehicles on pricier rides. Nopes. Many stink worse than a public transport. Billing - despite using same credit card on multiple previous occasions, I am told they can't charge it on some of the rides.",

0,"I drove for Uber for about 4 months in Tucson. Riders are a bunch of crybabies who will leave a 1 star review if you don't let them drink their coffee in your car. Uber has fostered this mentality with its feedback system giving the rider a disproportionate amount of power. It was common for a rider to be disrespectful or abusive. Riders Never tip. Getting paid 95 cents per mile is nothing for what you put up with: traffic congestion, unreasonable riders, canceled rides, wear and tear on your vehicle, increased insurance rates, long waits at the airport, drunk riders, etc. ",
1,Been charged extra ride. Not one spot. 10 time is hilarious disgusting and I'm professional. When I look at my bank statement overcharge me many times in one day. From 7 to 10 charges to my debit card value of almost $300. I new to Uber and I'm very dissatisfied with this. Outcome are usually much every trip I make with my banker. Stay mad. But when I see you there I'm charging just one day 5 to 10 times. It's very unfair to me. Sorry I will never use Uber again.,
0,"I had requested a pickup and app showed 3 minutes, then 6 minutes, then 7 minutes so I cancelled and decided to get the bus. While waiting at the bus stop about 5 blocks away, the driver called and said he was there. I told him I left but he asked me to wait for a couple of minutes. Despite the fact that the bus was only 5 blocks away, he couldn't find me. My dumb decision as I let two buses pass by and as the 3rd bus arrived, my driver pulled up and told me he found me because of the passenger in the car. The first thing was that the driver was new, ok no problem, but the car had the overwhelming smell of flowers that you couldn't breathe. Then he took me on a circuitous that resulted in me being trapped in downtown traffic the complete opposite of my direction. ",
1,"I made an Uber reservation and after waiting for several minutes, the driver never showed up and then he cancelled the trip. I have 2 issue here: On top of this, Uber charged me with a cancellation fee, how ridiculous. I then again tried to reserve a ride, and now they charge me with $33 more with a reason of high demand. This seems like an on-purpose rip-off or a fake demand created. Will never use UBER again.",
1,"Driving for Uber was a bad experience. There is one enrollment office in South Florida and you are treated like cattle. When you become a driver, your app does not always work. There is no follow-up system that allows review of drives completed and so verify your earnings. Phone calls are not answered and messages are not returned.",

1,"Try cancelling your account and find big surprises.  Some of my friends thought they had cancelled their accounts along with their Credit card info.  However, after hearing my problem, they checked with Uber and surprise!  CC info was still there and accounts not closed.  Here is what happened to me.  i decided to use only the cash feature and delete my CC number.  They told me I could not even though other friends have signed up for and used the cash only option(may not be available everywhere, i guess).  After several days of back and forth emails to Uber I was finally told that I had 2 different accounts with 2 different CC's. one as a driver and one as a customer.  I find this interesting as I don't have a Drivers License or CC, only a debit card.  I am retired from Walt Disney!  It is just a on-going mess,  Consumers beware!",
0,I was charged a cancellation fee when an Uber driver cancelled my call 2 minutes prior to arrival. I tried to get a refund and they would not give it to me. Uber does not have the right to refuse a refund due a driver canceling trip. This is downright fraudulent. Driver canceling trips has nothing do with the customer. I will never do business with this company again.,
1,The other day I took Uber to my physical therapy appointment. I go using Uber every two weeks. I have been using Uber for this for about a year. I go to my appointment and return straight home. This time I was overcharged by more than $12 dollars. Uber claims I changed my destination on the return trip to my home. Obviously the driver neglected to report I had reached my destination before he continued to his next location so I was charged for those miles. Uber refuses to acknowledge the error and after numerous emails only respond with the same canned response. They won't even check with the driver or my trip history. And no phone number to speak with a live person. They don't care about their customers. I am switching to a different company.,
0,"In suburban Tampa, we requested a car to Tampa International Airport. The driver, Lillie, was totally rude and incompetent. The vehicle had her own personal luggage in the back, so there was no room for ours. Her comment, in barely understandable English, was that we should have said the ride was to the airport.  Duh. Apparently she did not know that Tampa International Airport is an actual airport.  She slammed the door and yelled that we would have to call another Uber. If you need an Uber in Tampa, be sure you don't get Lillie.",
1,"After using Uber (linked to Paypal), my Uber account was hacked. I received a text message in a Russian language. If I'm in Florida, how can I be using Uber in Russia? Hello. Next two large charges appeared on Paypal. Paypal immediately rectified the situation and imagine that they actually provide a phone number where you can call them! Uber. No. The hacker changed the name on my account and password so I can't log in. I've made 10 attempts to get this fixed - to no avail. Uber won't let you talk to anyone. And if you can't log in, you're hosed. My credentials have been compromised and they could care less. I can't even cancel the account. UBER BEWARE. What a scam operation. Guess my next steps will be an attorney.",
0,"I requested a ride via Uber last week while I was at the San Diego Padres stadium with my kids. The driver assigned to me claimed erroneously that ""roads are closed"" and simply gave up. Roads were not closed. No attempt to establish a separate meeting place. I suspect they got a better offer on another ride and ditched us. Took a real taxi cab and got to where I needed to go. I then found Uber tried to charge me $5 for the ""experience"". I disputed the charge and got that taken off my credit card. Not paying a penny for botched service. I will never bother with Uber again, period. You may pay more for a cab, but it's worth the added investment to ensure their commitment to pick you up will actually be honored and carried out professionally, unlike amateurs off the street.",
0,"This happened in Washington DC, need to get to the airport. Uber driver arrives, sees me and my family, kids, then leaves inmediately, without even saying why. Uber then charges me a $5 cancelation, charges me!!!. I don't know what to do, really need to get to the airpost, so I request them again. Another driver arrives, and does exactly the same thing. Uber does exactly the same thing of course and charges me another $5. What is this?. On top of all that, no way to contact them, worst service I've seen in my entire life.
Of course I am fighting them and I will get my money back one way or another.
Stay away.",
1,"Recently I got charged 2 $5 cancellation fees for requesting rides I did not request. I have no idea how they got requested and Uber not only didn't help but charged me for it! The fact that I have never cancelled a trip, that the requests were 10 mins apart (odd), and the customer is always right (if you want them to return) should have been enough for them to waive these fees. But they didn't. And I couldn't get anyone on the phone only email. They kept sending the same boiler plate email that they had investigated and the fees were legit. Terrible customer service that is going to cost them money. My husband and I were using them for work and personal and have since deleted our accounts. Now using Lyft.",

I think it is so wrong they will protect thieves that work for them and won't do a thing about it.",

Now who can I complain to?",
0,"I was charged a cancellation fee by a driver I never requested. I was already in vehicle with a driver who was completely confused because the requested Pool had him pick up 2 people from same location. I send Uber a message explaining this and they issue me a $5 credit to account. NO, I want a $5 credit back to my bank account! It may seem petty to some but I control my funds not Uber or anyone else. I explain to them I want refund to my account and their response that in accordance with their cancellation policy it can only be credited to my account, I've looked at the site and there is nothing that visibly shows cancellations are only credited to accounts. And if I'd known about this policy I would've discontinued use with Uber long time ago. ",
0,"While leaving Coachella festival on Sunday we were required to first go through the app and we would receive a 6 pin code to give to the driver. While he wouldn't give me his name I was able to get his license plate number California plates #**, make and model of vehicle was a jeep Cherokee. This man refused to give us a ride because we were heading to Indio and told us he would only give us a ride if we were going to Los Angeles or Orange County. This is the worst customer service as we were ready to go home and he just straight out denied us a ride because he would not make the money he wanted by giving us a ride. You guys shouldn't hire people that don't care about customer service and just deny people a ride because they simply don't think it's worth it.",

1,"Driver never showed and had the audacity to charge me for the full ride. I paid for it, was left with no ride and super late for my event. I finally called a cab - yes a CAB which showed up, more than I can say for MARIO, Jersey City driver from hell. If you see Mario as your ride, cancel it asap. He charged me 100%, for a ride I never took. Never saw him, ever. Uber refused to credit my account,after 4 requests.. So here is how they do business: Charge you whatever they want, and never even have to pick you up or be accountable for leaving you stranded. I WILL NEVER USE UBER AGAIN! By the way, how about common courtesy for a customer who was been a loyal passenger for years, this is how they treat people. BE warned, until you face it, you won't believe it. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE whatsover. I boycott Uber and will pass the word along as many times as I can",
1,"This annoying uber company keeps charging my account for trips i didnt book. They charge a non existing trip when all my family members were at home over the weekend. when nobody went anywhere, they came up with a trip charge. It was very annoying there is nobody to complain to. I was charged for a trip when I wasn't in the country for heaven sake. Many charges on my account to Uber company are pretty questionable. Once your bank details are loaded, you can't delete, this means they have access to your money anytime. Uber is a fraudulent company, I will continue to seek for justice until I see it.",

I was told via video chat that Uber would get the inspection right away, 2 weeks later and still they do not have anything. I have tried to get a hold a person to verbally talk with and nothing. Just emailing and then there are more than one person trying to help and then it get aggravating. I think they have the worst service as far as helping the drivers. I am about to no longer drive for them because this is just getting out of hand. If you want to have great drivers give them better service when it comes to helping them.",

,"Let's be honest, who would mind paying couple $$ for a ride and relax in the back set listening to music and not dealing with traffic, especially here in LA. But Uber won't let you enjoy this convenience as much especially recently when they changed some of their policies. Here is an example, it is late at night, you just had fun in your friend's house and it is time to request Uber to take you home. You request Uber. Wait outside for the driver. In this phase, ETA become slow. 8 minutes waiting.",

I have been an Uber passenger on many occasions and never had a fare adjusted. My fare was absolutely incorrect and my driver selecting my trip is great, however, I wish to not pay a much higher fare for a type of ride I did not select.

1,"Concept of Uber is great. Try finding customer service is the pits. Once you contact them via messaging you will find that if you have an ongoing conversation, replies their system is set up to tag next available service rep. Meaning every time you send in your reply, a new service rep has to review all the conversations to get the rest of the customer's problem. Extremely time consuming on both parts. My wife is presently texting them as I write. I'm not a patient man and have spent two three days going back and forth on a relatively simple question. ""How do I add my payment method to my account"". Simple right? What a BS management team they have. It usually lies on management too.",
0,"On the evening of March 25, 2017, I scheduled an early morning ride with Uber for March 26 to Dulles airport. A few minutes after our requested pickup, the driver called and said he was on his way. We noticed on the Uber app that his vehicle was at Dulles and was not moving towards our location. The driver subsequently called and cancelled the pickup. Since we did not have sufficient time to make alternate arrangements, we drove our own vehicle to the airport and paid $272 for two weeks of parking. We noticed that the Uber vehicle remained in the same position in the Dulles area while we were in route to the airport. Up to this experience, we have been pleased with the Uber service, however, we will not rely on Uber again when we need to be somewhere at a certain time.",

0,Visited Orlando Florida and used Uber twice to return from Universal Studio. The first day I was charged 15.88 and the second trip cost 9.34. When I questioned the first driver about the route we were taking he advised he missed his exit causing him to take the next exit which was completely out of the way. The second driver took the direct route with no problem. When I questioned Uber customer service they explained how algorithms work and found no fault with the fare. I received my receipt and noticed the total should have been 12.84. They did refund the $3 difference but refused to acknowledge the difference in price between the first and second driver even though it was entirely driver error. After researching this seem to be a somewhat common practice. Will use Lyft in the future.,

1,I have had an ongoing complaint with Uber and it has finally hit the boiling point. I have been taking Uber quite faithfully twice a day for several months now and my pick up and drop off locations have never changed however Uber consistently changes the one address every time. I was OK with that since I was still getting where I needed to be until they started changing the quoted fees as well. When I called them out on it they would say that they had checked and that the information they had was correct. I have emailed them copies of the address plaque on the building where they are picking me up and they are still insisting that I am being picked up at a different address and that it is a longer ride and therefore a higher fare. The address they are insisting is wrong. Is the address for the commuter train station! The really irritating part is that the place that they are insisting I am being picked up at is the building where they house the trains!!,

0,"It has happened to me 3 times in a row that I had scheduled a ride and the drivers never showed up. 
One driver never showed up called me stating that he missed an exit both times I missed my flight to the airport. You guys have bunch of fags working for you guys can't tech on time Uber is not reliable at all because they are making so much money they don't care about their customers I submitted a complain last time no one responded me don't have any number that you can call they are just app based and have a horrible service! Driver name was NABIN driving TOYOTA VENZA plate# T694057C don't trust this driver charged me money and never gave it back. Very upset about this situation",
1,"We are going on vacation soon and it was suggested by our resort that uber would be less costly than a taxi. I set up an uber account. Because I did not want to store a card number that was attached to my account or use a credit card that has thousands of dollars available to use I purchased a my vanilla visa debit card.  I talked to my vanilla and ask them if this would be a card I could use with uber. They assured me of the cards available this card would be the one to use.
I tried several times to set up the uber account using this card and they would not take it. Not only that but the customer service people totally suck at their job. Basically I was told to bad so sad - and at no time did anyone investigate if there was a reason why you can not use this type of card. they just said sometimes they just don't work use a credit card. This type of card is used by many to receive direct deposit of payroll instead of having a checking account. One would think that uber would do some investigation to find out why there is a problem. So if you want to try and protect yourself by using this type of card don't expect uber to try and help figure it out.  Worst service I've ever received. Given all the other bad things I've seen in the news lately about uber workers and the CEO this should not surprise me.",
0,"I live in SF and I will NOT use Uber (and Lyft) anymore because of rude driver behavior. I have found too many of the drivers, from those companies, don't follow basic courtesy of at least pulling off the road for a pickup or drop off. And I mean with a curb space a mere 2 feet away. In fact I saw a driver pick up a passenger in the middle of an intersection (granted it was a 3 way intersection). He block the traffic as is so often the case. Both companies need to list to their customer that the driver will stop at the closest parking or off road location. And drivers need to pull OFF the roadway.",
1,"I used Uber once in a while because 1. they are really expensive. Their app has got problem. 2. I can not contact the driver in any way and every time I try to contact them it directs me to Uber Help which I believe there is nobody there to help. 3. You can never call Uber and talk to somebody, it sounds like to be that the whole thing is software and machine controlled. 4. If you by any chance cancel your ride they will charge you... 5. They are screwing taxi drivers, which are after and better. 6. Where I live they only have UberX which is nonsense and it is more expensive than Uber. They are making tons of money with their stupid application and system therefore I am deleting the app.",
1,"So I recently decided to give this $#*!ty business and app a try. First let me say there is no one to call when you have issues. Anyway,I download my app set up my account and begin to get a driver now first, I use my debit doesn't let me no explanation just unable to use try different payment. Okay credit card. NOPE!!!   Okay create my pay pal. Again unable to use payment try different form of payment. What!!! Fix your $#*!!!!  I even bought a *****@kng gift card and couldn't use that piece of crap. O and by the by the way all this time had me so damn late because I had to now take the train which if you don't know not all trains on Nj transit stop at the same locations so which an urber 25 min tops with traffic turned into 2 hours and 17 minutes.  I had to get a cab which to the train from my place 20$ where the whole urber ride was 13$ then round trip ticket 16$ then another 16 more for cab from train to appt back to train. Did I mention when I got back to train from appt. Yep you guessed had to wait 51 minutes for train then over 25 min on the ride when back to Dover instead of paying for another cab I waited yep 35 more minutes for my girl to pick me up. Thanks Urber could have been dropped off at station in the morning right on time then wouldn't havre been late and after appt got picked up on time from station. But instead of using train was going to take urber because it was the same price.  So I say again when your working it's great but it always has some sort of issue and no one to call you suck!!!!! Get your broken ass together and fix your issues for the future customers because you will need them you just lost one today I give you 2 middle fingers up for your performance!!",
1,"They deducted total 202 Rs. for very short distance share/pool ride while showed only 54 Rs. while booking the cab. They first deducted 148 Rs. from my Paytm account after the ride completed on 22nd March around 8:30 pm. Then while I complained to customer care, next day they told they adjusted the fare to 54 and rest 148 will be refunded back in 3 days, and again deducted 54 Rs. from Paytm on 23rd March in the morning 7:53 am (I did not take any ride). So total 202 (148+54) Rs. deduction happened. Now after 6 days while I inquired asking about my money they told it was longer route and refund not processed. While I did not take any longer route after asking again and again. Also they only saying money is adjusted and no update about refund. Such a cheat.",
1,"I was in NYC last night Wed 3/29/2017 with a friend. I came in by helicopter and was departing later the same way. I never requested a ride. Nothing on my phone showing I did. But there was 2 missed calls and a voicemail. 1st at 7:37 pm, then 7:39 pm. I called him back and he said he would need to charge me a cancel fee for not showing up. This has to be a scam, as there is no evidence on my phone that I ever requested a ride. I did contact Uber and they said it was a legitimate charge??",
0,"Uber will lose the race to Ola eventually. The negative news they find themself surrounded in will soon bring it down. I did not give much to those negative news until I recently (28th March 2017) witnessed their lack of customer care. The Uber cab was requested to reach Ramaiah Hospital at 3.00 pm. He did, but he refused to pick up my aunt who was on wheelchair. She was released from hospital after full recovery but aged 91, we did not want her to walk. He zoomed away in style. What did that moron expect when a customer calls from a hospital. We called the reliable trustworthy Ola and reached home sound and safe. In the process Uber lost a potential base of at least 50 customers (all my relatives whom we shared this incident with and we decided to stay away from Uber).",
1,"Called and Uber black car to get my husband and me to DFW airport. The estimate for the premium black car was $91.00 but we decided to go for it this one time. We went the 20 miles from downtown Dallas to DFW in about 40 minutes since it was 7:00 in the morning. When I got settled on our plane I checked my account to see that they had charged me $152.00!!! I have been going back and forth with them for a week now and all I get is ""The fare you were charged is within our estimate for a trip from your pickup location to destination. As a result, the fare was not adjusted."" Even though I have told them it was NOT what they estimated, I continued to get the same reply 4 different times. I finally just cancelled my account. There was no other recourse except to now tell my story so someone else won't get ripped off like I was!  By the way, the taxi ride back during evening rush hour was $50.00!!!",
1,"Had difficulty figuring out the app on my Phone and as a result had to cancel the trip as soon as I entered it, the address I had entered for home and the place I was going came up wrong. I did not notice this until I booked the ride. Soon as I realized the error I canceled the trip. I actually had this error several time and canceled my ride. I made several other errors in trying to schedule a future pickup time and had to cancel the ride again. ",
,"A week ago I tried Uber (hotel near LAX). I was told a car would be there in 5 mins but then the driver called and cancelled. A second one did the same and I got a cancellation message. However, I was charged $5. I reported it but all I get was a ""credit."" This has happened before - in NYC. Complained but all I got was a credit which I have never been able to use. In any other business this would be called scam. In future I will use a cab - at least I don't get charged when they are not there.",

0,"I requested Uber 3/24/17. We were going uptown. I live 10.2 miles from downtown Nashville. My rate was quoted at between $15 and $17. We used Uber there and back. I checked my bank account the next day and to my surprise Uber had charged me $34.50 going to Nashville and $15 coming back. When I inquired about this I was basically given the runaround telling me that I put in a different address than where we went. Once I showed them the Google mileage and the receipt that I printed out from Uber showing that I put in the correct address, now they have changed it to ""It was a demanding night, so the fares went up."" That is really funny because the girl who drove us said it was a slow night. Uber overcharged then tried to lie about it. I will never use Uber again.",
0,"I have been using Uber for a couple of years now. I use UberPool at least once a week. I recently requested a ride home from babysitting and was pretty upset when I was charged more than what I agreed to and that they wouldn't honor the initial price. The price I was told was $5.83, but when I got home I saw that it was $11.12. The driver did miss the exit and add more time and distance, so I figured that once I explain this to customer service that they would refund me the difference as this was not my fault. I hope that the driver didn't do this intentionally. They did not, and are standing by what they charged me. I am pretty heated and I am going to start to use Lyft as much as possible even though it is a little more expensive. I am super disappointed with their customer service.",
1,"I woke up one day to find that someone had ordered a ride using my account in Philadelphia while I was asleep in New York. Naturally, I changed my password and sent an email to Uber's support team so that they could look into the issue. They did not look into the issue whatsoever, would not issue a refund, and failed to provide me with a number to call so that I could speak with a representative. Apparently, if someone steals your information from their poorly protected site/app and uses your money to pay for a ride, all Uber cares about is that someone paid for the ride. This will not be the only place I file a complaint.",
1,"I have ridden with Uber 3 times, each time with drivers who are new to America and don't speak English. When I want to make sure I get English speaking driver, I have no way to call UBER. It is just easier to pay local cab a few dollars more for known drivers. I have deleted Uber.",
0,"I have had a UBER driver who lingers in front of my apartment window... sometimes with headlights on and shining into my apartment. He lurks out there all hours of day and night.

Complain if you ever get this creepy driver!",
1,"I received a ride that was 13 miles and took less than 30 minutes. My original estimated coast was $27 the initial charge was $25. 
24 hours later, I received an email stating the driver adjusted destination and my fee was adjusted to $160. I disputed the charge stating the original destination was correct. I Provided screen shot of google maps and pick up and drop addresses. After multiple emails back and forth, still no luck of Uber correcting the, what I call a, ""fraudulent charge"".  Customer service is less than desirable to say the least.  I have been giving the runaround. I have asked for a contact number to speak with someone live but no such luck.  I am now forced to dispute the charge with my credit card company and will being filing a complaint with the better business bureau.  I understand mistakes happen but failure to correct mistakes is in enexcusable. Uber not only lost a routine customer today but also gained poor advertisement from a dissatisfied customer. I will warn friends and coworkers against using Uber. To many other options.",

0,"Requested a pickup in Seattle at 4:25PM on March 23rd and the request was accepted with a 7 minute ETA. I placed the pin exactly where I was standing in a very visible spot on a sidewalk that was easy to access. Watched the driver drive all around me on the Uber app but never coming closer than 3 or 4 blocks. After 30 minutes of this a message popped apologizing for the inconvenience, but the DRIVER cancelled, which now made me late for my dinner reservation. Adding insult to injury, I also saw that they charged me a $5 cancellation fee. I immediately disputed this and after many exchanges where I explained what happened and also pointed out that the driver far exceeded 5 minutes past the 7 minute ETA which entitled ME to cancel per THEIR OWN POLICY, the most they would do is ""promise"" a $5 credit on a future ride.",

I called Uber again requesting Uber again and the charge came up as $38.00 and gave a name of the driver and he was less than 10 minutes away. So I am in the parking lot of the business with my luggage, when he drove in. I waved to let him know I was the one. I am sure he saw me he was within 50-75 ft. away. Without hesitation he did a hard 180 degrees and sped out of the parking lot and was gone, without a word. I was a bit aggravated, So I dialed up Uber again. To the same pickup and same delivery points.",
1,"I have been an avid Uber rider for quite a while. But recently, they've been in the business of disabling rider accounts for NO APPARENT REASON. I'm stranded in the freezing rain trying to request an Uber, and my account is disabled and they won't tell me why. They keep telling me it's for SECURITY reasons. Well I pay all of my fares so there's no reason for my account to be disabled. Today was the last straw. I requested a ride to work, which of course needed to be in a timely manner. The driver was initially around 5 minutes away. But 5 turned in to 10 minutes, which turned into 15 minutes. ",
1,"I ordered an uber to get to work this morning and after 5 minutes of not moving, the driver called and said if I wanted a ride, I would need to go with him to LAX.  That obviously was not an option, so I canceled.  I should have insisted that the driver canceled, but lessons learned.
Anyway, I was charged a cancellation fee and immediately complained.  Respond #1 fored back immediately from ""SC"" saying we charged you correctly.  I said no you didn't and asked for a refund.  Hazel L provided me a credit, which would have been fine if that was the initial response, but since I needed to go through hoops, I demanded a refund back to my credit card.  Gretchen C responded that is against policy.
Mind you, I am a 400 dollar/month uber user (I used uber eats at work pretty often) so this absolutely blew my mind.  I can say that uber has officially lost a user forever, I hope the company implodes with the recent negative PR storm that has hit them.
Congrats Lyft, eat24, and postmates, you have a new customer!",
0,"The first time I used Uber, the driver rushed me (I had him waiting for 2 minutes at 4:30 am), didn't help me with luggage and was very rude. The next time, the opposite. So, it is a toss up, depending on the individual. I DID have a very bad taste in my mouth from the first experience.",
1,"I took uberPOOL and the rate came to 13.40 and used promo code for $5 discount. While alighting my driver said to pay 8.40. I paid cash and alighted. Again on 16.03.2017 I took and it showed 10.90 I confirmed pick up. While alighting driver asked 15.90. I said ""why"" he said I had $5 balance to pay to Uber. I didn't want to block the road and cause traffic jam so I settled. Strange! Do you even have credit facility for Uber trips. I didn't give my card details only cash payment. Then how they let me alight for less fare and charge it later. Discrepancy in fares and that too after 5 days charging. I wanted to refund the extra $5/ charged to me but Uber complaint firm asks for my card details when I am dealing in cash only. I would like Uber co to clarify why I was charged extra. Now my trip list also doesn't show those previous discrepancy.",

1,We tried getting an Uber THREE time and they canceled on us each time and waited until the last minute to cancel on us. This is terrible customer service. It's honestly unbelievable. DONT USE UBER.,
1,I took on a trust factor with Uber and I got ripped off and was left in cold and I suffered severe pain as well. The drivers are great but whoever is doing the money part they took too much. In return I had no way home. I kept telling them what they did. They kept showing me receipt when days before it was a lot lower.,
1,"I have been a loyal customer of Uber. I cannot even get a hold of anyone. The drivers have been great. However their charging system is unprofessional and unreliable. I am going to have to report lost or stolen due to them. They do surcharges which flash so fast you don't even get a chance to see their charges. They also start charging you for rides that you do not even take or had even requested or even authorized. This is how they get your money and scam you. I wouldn't trust Uber unless it is a once in awhile type of thing, because when you are a continuous customer they drain your account and if you don't watch it closely you could be overdrawn with many fees. Luckily I watch mine. I am going to have to go to Lyft. Hopefully they are better.",
1,"I have used Uber in Miami Beach, Rio de Janiero, and Costa Rica. It is fast and convenient to get a car to my location, and the fact that there is no guessing what the cost of the ride is going to be is simply excellent. What I really like the most is the fact that you know who your driver is going to be and what type of car he is driving.",

When the cab arrived I realized it was sharing,initially I found it a little weird but I agreed to get into the car.the sharing drop was at prabhadevi.so I insisted the driver to drop me first since Wadala comes First.the driver agreed to drop me,but later said that the route on his phone was prabhadevi so he has to drop me 2nd.I told him I would like to get down and asked him how much did it cost.He said he will only be able to tell me once my trip ends.which i found ridiculously lame.Only if uber could come up with a better solution to cancel or discontinue the service.I had a bull$#*! experience will never travel uber in India atleast.WORST experience. 1)wasted 1.30mins of my time and will also recommend my family and friends not to take uber atleast in India.",
0,"I requested a trip using UberPool. I have been using it daily to the same location. Today, when I received an Uber receipt, my daily charge of $2.99, was higher, $8.18. I used their app to dispute the charge, but receive a crazy response stating that I was charged correctly. They are liars and too lazy to even research the issues. Looking at the map on the app, the driver drove to my location, then continued on. No one else was in the car with me. He should have ended the call when I reached my location.",
1,Uber has proven itself to be a reliable source of door-to-door service for when one does not have one's own mode of transportation.,
0,Excellent app. Doesn't beg for tips. Lets you rate driver's ambiance. Shows proximity of driver to your location. Allows 2 way communication with driver en route.

After 20 mins I called driver 2 times he did not pick up. I cancelled the car 5 mins later (total of 25 mins). I ordered a new cab on app that came in 5 mins... They charged me for ride and cancellation fee. I emailed them since there is no customer service number and they basically told me because I cancelled I'm being charged. They are crazy and basically called me a liar. Why would I order another cab if I was lying and they refuse to credit my card... So now I had to cancel my card. I will never ever, ever use their service again. They even put in my wrong address. They are crooks. Imagine how many people they get this way... It's disgusting.",

And very rude.",
1,"I lost my cell phone in an Uber vehicle on a vacation to Las Vegas.  Trying to track down the driver was a 12 day nightmare.  Uber's doesn't really have a customer service.  They have a few people available on twitter or a Uber lost item report that will eventually get a response.  First Uber does not have a lost item link of their website home page or App.  They also demand full rude detail, drivers name, date of trip, cost of trip, time of trip and pickup and drop off locations.  So if you lost your phone, and don't have access to their app or a computer your screwed.  I send various Uber contacts a minimum of 25 messages.  Only when I purchased another iPhone and another SIM card from my service provider could I go through the secure process to use my old phone number and get into the app to get the ride detail.  So I give them the detail that they could have looked up any time and they basically tell me that the driver has my phone and that I need to contact the driver through the app to get my phone back.  Then then scolded me for opening multiple threads containing the sMe issue and sId my case was closed.  I complained asking them how they could close my case when I do not have my phone back, they did not reply because they don't care.  I went through their "" contact the driver"" process 7 times over 4 days and no one ever answered.  Only on my 8th try did I reach the driver 12 days after it was lost in the car.  Uber is an arrogant, rude company that does not care about providing customer service.  The have no toll free numbers for customers and their online support is terrible.  They tell you that they have sent you several DM's.  I said I looked and could not find any Direct Messages from them.  That's because the messages are hidden in their app under a help link.  How are customers supposed to know that?  I now use Lyft and they are awesome and will never ever use Uber again.  I want to be very clear, the driver is not the problem, when I was finally able to reach him he was polite and very helpful.  This is all Uber's rude unfriendly business model",
0,Drivers are allowed to cancel for no reason and the customer is charged a cancellation fee. Is this Ubers new scam?,
0,"Figure out how risky it is that UBER can charge right into your credit card whatever they want after the fact!!! One day on the same route, I was charged 3 times as much as with other driver, some UBER driver intentionally took a longer route to get to my destination to charge me more, I did not know until after the trip when I check my emails by end of the day, it was too late and it was very hard to find a right subject to submit a complaint with UBER. Their customer service is horrible: they don't listen to your complaint, they are just using patterns of reply. I WILL NOT USE UBER AGAIN as I think some Uber drivers have a way to rob customers.",

0,"Whether I am using Uber for a ride service or Uber Eats ordering food the service has been terrible. Out of the 10 times ordering food from Uber Eats 9 times food has been forgotten. Every time I have requested a refund for the missing item until recently they told me to refrain from this type of behaviour and told me they would be restricting my account. Not sure why I should be punished for their drivers not checking the food prior to delivery. Recently while traveling I ordered an Uber to the place I was staying, I notified the driver it was a tricky place to find and even provided extremely specific instructions. I attempted to contact the driver numerous times but had no response. The driver cancelled the trip and I was charged a cancellation fee. I guess moral of the story is this company makes the consumer pay for their employees mistakes. Please refrain from using this service if possible, I know I'll be finding alternatives.",

Might just go back to taking cabs.",
0,"Last night I returned home from the airport using Uber. Shared a ride. The other person paid $36.97 vs my $58.42. First stop was their residence (farther away from the airport than my place). Needless to say, I was not happy when I heard that my fare was 58 percent more. Uber says it's ""dynamic pricing"" and will not issue me a partial refund. And... with the company burning through its cash at over $1 billion a year and turmoil in the executive ranks, one would think the company might be more sensitive to such inequalities.",
1,My last 2 experiences with Uber have made me use taxis which turned out to be preferable to Uber. Two weeks ago called for an Uber and my driver did not speak or understand English so I immediately got out and was still charged on Tuesday. October 24th I requested an Uber to take me to midway airport. When I received notification that my driver had arrived--I called since I was already waiting outside. He informed me that he was in Lombard. And here I was at the place I am always picked up in Chicago. Guess I am on to Lyft.,
1,"Our party of 6 consisted of three of my adult daughters and two friends going wedding dress shopping. We needed an SUV to accommodate all of us, and Uber showed a driver 20 minutes away in Sanford, Florida. Perfect, we thought as the reservation wasn't for another 40 minutes. We waited, and waited but the map showed the driver staying at the same place originally shown, yet the eta remained the same. We thought that the map must be frozen, so a reset was done, and then it showed that the driver had picked us up and was on route to someplace other than where we were going AND WITHOUT US! To make matters worse, our credit card was charged and we were very late for our appointment. There must be a way for Uber to assure that your card is being used for YOUR trip and not for someone else.",
0,"75% of the time I'm extremely satisfied, but here are my pet gripes: 1) No flat rate from airport, as there are with taxis and limos. From JFK we got stuck at the midtown tunnel and my fare (time + distance) was almost twice the flat taxi fare. 2) The driver's profile does not indicate if they have a FasTrak transponder. Coming from LAX to DTLA on two occasions we were stuck in traffic on the I-110 because the driver didn't have FasTrak and so we couldn't use the express lanes. When a driver accepts the request, if the snapshot description (name, make of car, license #, etc) also had ""Can use FasTrak express lanes - Yes/No"" I would know to reject a pickup from a driver if they lack FasTrak. Another solution would be to have an option in my profile's preferences, to only accept drivers who have FasTrak.",
1,"I had driven to KCVG to leave a rental car. Having used Uber oh let say a half dozen time in my life. I charge up my phone that had gone dead.

I take the shuttle to terminal and do not summon ride until at pickup site. Here is the hurtful thing... Now I could be wrong. While I am looking at the drive from Lyft I get this call from the Uber driver... ""I am outside..."" the way the exchange starts.",

I thought maybe my credit card was not working here so I paid him cash, later I found out my credit card was also charged. When I requested the refund from Uber they give me excuses by automated reply like it's my fault I would have not given cash to Driver. What I supposed to do when driver is insisting to pay cash after completion of ride. At that time there was no way so I could confirm from UBER office before paying. Uber sent automated emails saying wouldn't have a refund option for this exact issue. SO NO MORE UBER.",
1,"My last two experiences with Uber were not too great. The car that picked me up was old, dirty and nasty with dog hair everywhere and the air conditioner didn't work. It was 90+ degrees out and we had to ride with the windows down. The experience was a ride to the airport and that was frantic. The man had only been in my town for a few weeks and he was confused on how to get to the airport. I don't think Uber is checking on who's driving and in what vehicles.",
1,"Uber is frud , uber driver charged double amount from me on 20/10/2017. I was traveling from Thane to vikroli. I checked amount was Rs 176. After dropping me he charged Rs. 470. About this problem I discussed through sms but no positive response from customer care. They are not even return my money. Driver create show on the road so I paid money. But customer care people are also frud people. They don't want to resolve the Issue
My suggestion is don't go With uber. They don't even have contact number. They are cheaper and cheater",
1,"It's unfortunate to know that Uber allows its drivers to rate clients. My rating with Uber was 4.86 and after a recent trip out of town and used Uber my rating dropped to 4.63. I was kind and friendly to the driver. I engaged in the conversation that he started, I also sent him an additional tip post my trip. I will no longer ride with Uber and leave a driver who may be unhappy in his or her job or having a bad day or expecting a cash tip to rate me as a client and passenger. I treat all people with kindness and respect and my driver ratings have always been very good to excellent. You have lost a loyal customer.",
0,"DO NOT ACCEPT RIDE WITH UBER DRIVER ""EDGAR"" IN SILVER TOYOTA SIENNA VAN!!! Me, my husband, and six year old daughter requested an Uber to take us back to the Sanford International Airport Wednesday, October 25th from Disney's Art of Animation Resort. We had a great experience with our trip to the resort the Wednesday prior with Mike who drove a grey Lexus. That fare totaled $40.49 and we tipped him $10. That said, we requested another Uber X for our trip returning to the Sanford airport with the same expected $40 fare - this was the fare provided when we accepted ride.",
1,"I received e-mails from Uber asking me why I do not take Uber anymore. There is no way to reply to - they only SEND emails, they DO NOT ACCEPT e-mails.1. AUTOMATED customer service is the biggest problem of Uber. That is the first reason for which I stopped taking Uber. I tried to call Uber when in need. I found with difficulty a number on the web. I called it and a stupid message said: ""Don't bother leaving a message, there are 20,000 messages in this mailbox"". Whoever left that message was a major $#*!, Probably Travis Kalanick or one of those cocky bastards that Uber has plenty of.2. Uber VERY POOR customer service has cost me $ 650. In May 2016 I forgot my new iPhone ($650) in the Uber and there was NO WAY to retrieve it - there is NO Uber phone customer service where one can talk to a live person and explain the problem.That's a big flaw. I called Uber automated customer service from a hotel and never received an answer. I e-mailed multiple times, I left feedback over the Uber website. I received a response only TWO DAYS afterwards. Of course, TWO DAYS afterwards my iPhone was long gone. That is why Uber poor customer service has cost me $ 650. Uber has not offered me any compensation for that - and THE SAME THING can happen again. 3. The cars are often dirty. I initially switched from taxis to Uber because I cannot stand taxis that are dirty and smell of food because the driver eats in there. However over time the Uber has started being just as bad. There is no quality control of car. I have had dirty Uber cars, or banged up Uber cars or drivers that couldn't follow a GPS and took much longer than they should have. The dirtiness is by far the biggest problems.
In contrast, Lyft has CLEAN cars. It enforces cleanliness.4. I do not care about the negative press that Uber has had. However, I do care very much about:
- the car being CLEAN, with NO FOOD SMELL
- the driver that knows how to drive and follow a GPS.
- your having an ACTUAL customer service. It is impossible to e-mail Uer - though uber DOES send email to you. Until Uber solves these problems, I will no longer take Uber cars. I will go to Lyft and other competitors, every time.",
1,This guy is the worst Uber driver I have ever met he doesn't even show up when asked to be picked up do not let him drive you anywhere,
0,"Alexandria, VA - October 6, 2017: I was charged a ""waiting fee"", even though I was standing precisely at the GPS location from which I requested the ride, in front of my home, when the Uber driver pulled up. The Uber driver did not have to wait even one minute. In fact, it was I who waited for the Uber driver to show up. Manhattan, NY - October 6, 2017: I was charged a ""waiting fee"", even though I was standing precisely at the GPS location from which I requested the ride and at which the Uber driver picked me up.

0,"On Oct. 8, 2017 at 1:12:45 PM - There should be No charge for this ride. Despite using a GPS, this driver tried to take a closed entrance to the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel and then had to detour back to the original entrance Once in Manhattan. And 10 blocks from our theater destination he took another wrong turn and ended up in New Jersey. By the time he got back to Manhattan it was already past the starting time of the play we were going to. As a matter of fact it was already 30 minutes into the play.",
1,"I requested a ride from my residence to Publix grocery store, $8.48 and $5 tip. When finished shopping, I found my phone was not in my pocket. Upon exiting, the driver was outside with my phone. I had dropped it in her car and she returned it. I was very grateful. Return home was $7.15 and $5 tip (a different driver). Checked my bank account when I got home, was charged total of $48.84. Registered concern in the app. There is no customer service phone number. I was sent a message that I was charged $15 for returning my phone. Still a discrepancy. I replied and my concerned was totally dismissed. Message said complaint was resolved. Terrible service. No more Uber for me.",
0,"I had selected my card as the payment method but when I reached my destination the driver requested a cash payment and I obliged since Uber has a refund option for such circumstances but when I requested the refund they give me excuses like it's my fault for not checking the payment method, etc. If that was the case, they wouldn't have a refund option for this exact issue. This is the second time Uber has done this to me and it is the only reason why I'm lodging a complaint here.",
0,"This is a complaint about a trip on 28.9.17 ordered at 8.25 a.m. Eastern time in Boston. The expected arrival time delayed a lot, 3 min, 6 min, 9 min, 4 min and so on. Then after approx 12 minutes a message came that Driver ** has cancelled the trip! For reference: the surcharge when booing was factor 1.4. Then my host Jennifer booked for me, meanwhile the surcharge was 2.4. I finally arrived with much delay at the railway station. The driver just cancelled since he expected more profitable trips to perform during that time. This practice was confirmed by another Uber driver in Boston when I openly talked with him. On top of all they charged me 5 USD for cancellation. I did not cancel. Finally Uber paid me back only the 5 USD cancellation fee, they did not refund me the approx 15 USD loss being the difference between factor 1.4 and 2.4.",
1,"Uber drivers in Sydney (and other cities around the world ) have a bad habit of accepting jobs from miles away and sometimes up to 20mins, while still dropping off a passenger and while there are dozens of cars very close to the new job location. I had one this morning again to take me from home in Rushcutters Bay to work in the city and there were at least 6 cars within 1-2mins from my location. This the ** Uber driver, still took the job while still in the city some 15mins away. Uber needs to do something about this sort of behaviour as it ruins the customer experience and make people angry, if customers want ** service they would take a cab. The solution could be very simple, offer a function on the app for the users to manage a circular area around the pickup zone beyond which Uber drivers are excluded from picking up rides. Simple!!",
0,"My experience with Uber was in San Francisco in April 2017. Uber is still hiding in the shadow and will not come up front and center to pick you up, they lurk around the corner, and if the wait too long for you they cancel the ride. This is a damaged game of hide and seek.",
0,"I use Uber all the time, but I am officially done with this unprofessional company. Guess it would be a crime to be able to talk to someone in person at Uber. Uber is letting their drivers ripoff their riders. I have a service dog and in the last weeks have been charged twice a cleaning fee, without any input. The last one was for dirt spots on the seat that was already there. I am tired of drivers making extra money, whenever they feel like it. I am done being ripped off!!!",
1,** - Contact number of the driver. Absolutely not professional. I booked a cab and it showed me 3 minutes away. Again it changed to 6 minutes away. Followed by 9 minutes away. I called him to guide him through. He purposely kept the phone on speaker and pretended like he could not hear me. Uber has really disappointed me. HORRIBLE.,

0,"If you are in the Philadelphia area and your uber driver is Daemon, cancel it real quick. When she picked me up she was at the wrong address so I had to literally walk a 1/2 block to her car and when she called me to ask where I was at, she was rude, even though she was at the wrong house!Her car smelled very bad (musty and dirty clothes) and it was dirty! She had water bottles on the floor and crumbs on her seats. I couldn't even dust them off because of the kind of seats she had. So I sat in crumbs the entire ride to work.When it was time to drop me off, she was at the wrong location once again and I had to get out and walk a block to my building. She is by far the worst uber driver and I have had some bad drivers but she is flat out terrible.",

I had cancelled many times...it's not funny anymore "" Uber"" . I am almost done with you ""uber"". This company Sucks! I've been nice to all your drivers even if sometimes some of the uber driver's stinks I was still polite towards him. Now I download Lyft and will try it. Thank-you Uber!!!",
1,"Uber Atlanta Horrible - I did Rideshare. The driver confused me with the other person that took the ride. I requested to be picked up from the Aquarium and go to Mary Mac's Restaurant. If you look at where the driver took the client it was not to that place. Uber charged me $4.77 for a ride I never took and believed the driver over me. Rideshare should not be used If you can't account for who took the ride. I was never picked up, the driver simply confused me with the other person. I had 3 rides scheduled but only picked up one time. Unfortunately, because of their growth, there's no way to account for what is real and not. I had the same problem in Washington D.C. but was able to get refunded.",
0,I ordered Uber in Seattle on 6/17. I was getting off a cruise ship and needed to go into the city. I contacted the driver that never arrived.

0,"I used Uber regularly a few years ago, then my driver got in an accident on the way to pick me up so I had to hop a train. The next time, a driver came to pick me up but I could smell alcohol on his breath so I hopped a train again.

Now I use taxis whose drivers are licensed, bonded and insured.",

Cost $58.00 and no way to afford that for long after paying for food and lodging. Called Uber after that.

Got a mini sightseeing tour with every ride as they explained the surrounding area. Loved it. Thank you Uber.",
1,"I'm an avid Uber rider. On 9/30/2017, I ordered an Uber pool around 2pm. My fare was $8.98. The driver picked me up from my location. On the way to my dropoff, the driver picked up another passenger, dropped that passenger off. He proceeded to my dropoff, but he ended my ride by mistake. The driver had to load my dropoff address again. It's only after I got out the car, I realized my fare was duplicated. I've sent emails to UBER. They dont have customer relations, only email. They didnt refund me my money. On October 6, I used their service again. This time my fare was $30.92. This fare was obviously deducted from my Visa card and its also on my statement. On their app, UBER is claiming I have an outstanding payment, but I have PAID THEM. I need help.",
1,Uber charged me again for a wait time when I was outside waiting for the driver to pull up. Today I watched the driver pull up and got into the car. I even texted the driver my location beforehand so there would be no confusion. Then I look at my online receipt and I see the charge. This is the third time Uber has done this. I think it is a scam. I rated the driver really low and will change it once someone verifies that the drivers aren't responsible for this. I can't get anybody on the phone. Uber's customer service is atrocious. I can't keep using a service that tries to scam me at every opportunity.,

We were already in the street. There was no time to cancel and book a limo so we got in. As a result, our fare was augmented to $126. I complained and they reduced it to $114. I am still fighting for a fair settlement . Today I took a cab.",

Fares are 50-75% less than traditional cabs. Cars are clean and well maintained. Love Uber!",
0,New User. Tried to book a future pickup and thought we had. Realized that they dispatched a driver immediately and once I discovered this I cancelled.

0,"The Uber driver cancelled the trip himself without consulting me. I was waiting for the driver to pick me up. While I was waiting, I received the email that the trip is cancelled and I was charged R25. I struggled to get hold of them to solve the problem, because everything is online with them. I managed to submit my complaint with them online. They took about two hours to come back. A Mr ** told me I must check that the reverse the money back into my account, which is not true. They only reverse the amount which they would've charged me for the trip but not the cancellation fees. I sent Mr ** an email again and told him that I was not reimbursed with the cancellation fees. He replied to me with an attitude in bold that the driver must get paid for a cancelled trip and at the same time the attitude is ""what do you further want us to do. The matter is resolved and like leave it and keep quiet."" ",
0,"Uber's customer support via email is beyond words. The most horrible and worthless support group I have ever seen. These people don't read the cases, and subsequent replies are bizarre and repeat the previous CS rep reply. You will never have the same support rep even for the same case so there is no accountability or structure. It's quite unbelievable on all levels on how bad it is. At least as a writer you can dispute a credit card charge. But as a driver Uber can cheat you out of money and get away with it. I am a victim.",
0,"Uber came home faster for pick me up, the driver was a courteous and wait for me more than 4 minutes without charge me. The driver use a precaution and respect the speed limit.

1,"I have been a loyal user of Uber and it has always been my go-to means of getting from point A-B. But today, I've officially withdrawn and deleted their app. Heres why:
Two nights ago, I've ordered a cab for my girlfriend to get home after a huge argument around the time of 3 a.m. Keep in mind her phone died at the time. Her destination was from Manhattan to Brooklyn. The next day, she had told me she was dissatisfied with a pool customer who gave her an attitude and told my girlfriend to ""shut up"" after talking to the driver named Raja. She was tremendously upset to begin with and it caused her to get off the car a few blocks later, which took her to the 1 train. We are super easy going people and we have discovered the driver Raja, has NEVER ended the trip at the time she was dropped off- which was only 5 blocks later and had fully taken advantaged of the circumstances and drove an empty passenge car to her destination in Brooklyn. I did not fully realize this until it was too late - so I had rated him 5 stars before I got the chance to report him. Again we were in an argument so we didn't not talk until a day later.
First of all she and I were not drunk at all. And I have reached out to uber and they have refused to refund me for the amount of $27. Although the money is not the issue but the dishonest driver. I will be going to Lyft from now on. I do not regret my decision.
Also I notified uber and told them the details and these illiterate workers reviewing my complaint do not even respond to the problem but are confusing that I want a refund because the fare amount itself is wrong. I regret to say that Uber hires lousy drivers that take advantage of customers at 3am. and if they had looked into my transaction profile, I already spend quite a lot for cabs, theres no reason for me to go beyond for 27$ unless it was the truth",
0,"I have had several instances recently where I go to order and Uber tells me it's 2-3 minutes and then I confirm the order and it's 8-10 minutes (tech glitches).  I have also had drivers who can't speak English and I must tell them where to go despite them having their map app on their phone available to them.  Incompetent drivers and failing technology are not ingredients for a good user experience.  When notified of their failings, Uber curtly replies that they work hard to provide the best user experience.  Really, that's your best?",
0,"I've used Uber many times in CA and in MD. The app could be a bit more user friendly though. With the exception of one, all drivers have been friendly and have driven carefully. One time I had an issue with billing and customer service handled the problem immediately and to my satisfaction. I would definitely recommend Uber.",

0,"We used Uber in NYC recently and it was our first experience with the service. Almost all of our drivers over three days were prompt, courteous, and treated us with respect. I don't envy these guys' job, but we certainly appreciated them.",
0,"Earlier this year I attempted to apply as a driver but due to poor knowledge and a lack of direct communication provided by Uber I was unable to complete the hiring process. This company has no readily available personnel to assist you when you require immediate assistance. They simply direct you by text to attend an upcoming Uber meeting in some city if you have questions. They also collect and maintain personal driving records, personal identifiable information and documents of individuals who were unable to meet their requirements. Such information should be purged from their systems, not kept on file.",
1,I wonder how thoroughly the company's background check on prospective drivers really is. My concern comes from reports in the news on some drivers who have mental or otherwise criminal behavior.,
0,"We used Uber for the first time to attend a wedding reception in Portland and we loved it. The ease of using it was awesome. The people that picked us up were professional, clean and friendly.",
0,I'm not pleased with the Uber. They may project charges through one of my credit cards that they tried to refuse to remove but they were probably removed later on. Bye-bye credit card company. Also one of the drivers ran my wife over and broke her back in three places.,
0,"We only started using Uber this past year in Las Vegas, Nevada. A hotel staff member helped us download the app and use it. The drivers were very dependable, prompt and courteous. The cars were much cleaner than the cabs, and the rates were much lower. I am sorry to hear about the scandals that have recently besieged this company, and am hoping that the CEO's decision to take a leave of absence will help this company reform itself and improve its name. Unfortunately, Uber is not allowed to operate in my area, otherwise, my husband and I would use it more often.",

Our hotel offered to take us for $17 per person, but we opted to take Uber for the personal service and efficiency. We had an excellent driver and vehicle but when we arrived at the airport I discovered that Uber charged me $99.26! The worst part about Uber is that they make it so easy to book a trip but then they make it so difficult to contact them regarding any issues.",
0,"Uber drivers that I've dealt with have always been professional, safe drivers, and a pleasure to deal with. Their cars have always been clean, mostly newer models, and well-maintained. For the most part, the drivers get you in a short period time. However occasionally you might get a driver that suddenly realizes he doesn't want to take the call and you suddenly see on the map that he's going in a different direction. That could be frustrating when you're waiting for pick up, luckily, it has rarely happened. Overall, Uber is very good.",
0,"Uber arrived to pick me up within 10 - 15 minutes of being called. Clean, comfortable vehicles and good music. Courteous drivers and safe driving habits. During rush hour in an area I was very familiar with, a driver was willing to divert from his GPS directions and go the way I told him would avoid the traffic. But one driver was a little less accommodating and dropped me off with luggage to carry, across the street from my destination.",
0,"We were left STRANDED in rural Framingham MA, after dark, with no way to return to our hotel. My colleague is disabled and must use a cane. The evening which would have been memorable for many other reasons I am sorry to say will probably remain memorable because of Uber's actions. The problem all started when the driver showed up at our hotel, the Hotel Sheraton in Framingham, early on Saturday evening, September 24, 2017. We had dinner reservations for 5:30 that evening at a Framingham-area historic inn that both of us had been eagerly looking forward to visiting.",
0,"Arrived in LAX 8 hours ahead of schedule due to change of plans so our pickup wasn't available. My daughter suggested to try Uber so we did after comparing the fare going home which was about the same. A black shiny Suburban picked us up in less than 10 minutes. The van interior was clean so was the driver. He was pleasant to talk to and he drove us home safely. It was a pleasant experience that from now on, no more dirty taxis and smelly cab drivers for me.",
0,"Using UBER was a pleasant surprise and I love the fact that they are available on short notice. The prices are much more affordable than the taxi cabs I was using prior to UBER and fare payment via credit card is great. They offer and deliver good service which I felt was safe and everything already in the system and no need to pull out anything. I also tried UBER as driver for several months... It was fun! I only had one incident that caused me concern after calling UBER and confirming a ride. Between 11:00-11:30 pm close to a price surge time, I was switched to several different driver confirmations which caused a 45-minute wait and that night I finally called a cab.",
0,"I live in a very small town and at times there is no one available to pick up. Uber is great in large metropolitan areas. Drivers are very polite and punctual. I noticed that the ride would state a different amount, however after I am dropped off the price has increased. There is no customer service number. I understand that even the drivers don't have a main number to contact for Uber Corporate. That is a serious issue. Every company should have a human to speak with for concerns.",
0,"I will and always have admitted, it's not about loyalty but business. I supported uber in the past because they were getting the job done better than the cab companies. And in a sense they are still more efficient than the dying breed of the cab industry. However there are and will continue to be more rideshare business. Look what Napster did to the music industry and look where Napster is now? Uber has gone down hill for me as this whole rating thing has gotten out of hand. I am on time for my driver, respectful (treating them the way I want to be treated), and despite not liking the tipping I still do it. I don't like the rating as it's pointless. If I give the driver a bad rating legitimately they will and have rated me poorly. Anything less than a 5/5 for a driver is ""wrong"". So the passenger gets bullied into giving them a perfect score. Then there is this tipping which I have been in the service industry and support it but UBER was all about the no tipping and now if you don't tip enough or worse on time, the driver rates you poorly. Personally, I don't care if a drive likes me or not but when my rating can impact me getting a ride, this is where the problem is.Some examples I dealt with is I had a driver in Montreal who didn't speak English and I did the best I could to communicate in French and so my rating goes down. In Phoenix, my driver was soliciting his private driver business and when I couldn't use his same thing. And most recently in Seattle one driver was so depressing talking about how she has no friends and that she doesn't know Seattle well. I had to end up using my own gps using international Data and yet now I get a bad review. I was scared to give this lady a 4/5 yet alone worse. And I have gained other example.I have supported UBER coming to Calgary and Edmonton, even when they were booted out temporarily. Now that I live near Vancouver, I was supporting them coming there as well. Now, I'm starting to change my mind.My point is now I'm considering going with other options including the awkward hailing of a cab! Regardless, ride sharing will continue to grow, the question is, will UBER be a part of this or eventually not exist like Napster, being just another company that started a trend?FYI they make it hard for you to contact them with complaints unless you say you were in an accident.",
0,"I have used Uber 3 times. Once the driver got lost, causing me to miss my bus and costing me $60 extra fare. The other times were ok but I believe way overpriced. Sorry, not a fan.",

0,"My son booked me an Uber to take me to the station to catch a train to the airport. When I got in the driver started going at about one mile an hour and drove up loads of little side roads, going round in circles in completely the wrong direction and wasting a good 15 minutes. When I told him I had a train and flight to catch he suddenly said he was looking for other customers because it was a shared ride. I rang my son who said it definitely wasn't shared and to tell the driver to get a move on. He refused to. I asked could he then change it to unshared and charge the extra and he said no. I asked him to call his superior and he said there was nobody there to call. I explained that if I missed the one train an hour I'd miss my flight and there wasn't another one for seven days. Effectively I'd lose my whole holiday. He shrugged and carried on at one mile an hour. There was nothing I could do and even if I'd got out of his car he'd taken me down such quiet roads there was no chance of finding another cab. This was 3am in the morning and eventually after much screaming on my part he gave up looking for sharers - but I made it to the station with two minutes to spare and had to to try and run up numerous platform steps with two pieces of heavy luggage. I will never forget the experience and will never ever use them again.",
1,"When in Ann Arbor the Uber driver was polite and helpful but when in Chicago most drivers DID not come out of the car or speak unless we spoke except to ask where to. Also, the driver was not especially courteous or helpful. This was my first encounter with using Uber.",
0,"I use UBER when I go to Pittsburgh when my daughter wants me to go shopping, and doesn't want me to walk. She lives in Stanton Heights and the store is Shop-N-Save on Butler St in Lawrenceville and I feel very safe taking an UBER.",
0,Drivers will accept then never show. This has happened over 7 times. I've only been riding with Uber for a few weeks. Uber has made me late work because they say they're coming and never show up and then won't cancel the ride on their end so the company charges my card for the ride that's didn't show and a cancellation fee.,
0,"Used Uber once. Great experience and great concept for getting around without a great expense. Thought about making extra money as a driver. Rules for personal safety are for me. Overall, good business.",
1,"I waited through several drivers. I was in an unfamiliar neighborhood, but did describe my location adequately. When a driver finally showed up, he was hearing impaired; there was some difficulty making myself understood, but did make it to the airport in time, esp. as the flight was delayed. He drove quite fast, taking shortcuts. Made me a little concerned about safety.",
0,"They were always prompt, knowledgeable, courteous and professional. They are ideal for when you are out of town and I plan to use them often.",
0,"My child and my girl need to go to school early in the morning, I request an Uber taxi who cleverly went to the destination to pick my family (**) and then he call me, ""I am here where you at?"" I reply, ""In front of my building"" and he said of the put the wrong address to put up but the driver did not say nothing if he coming or not. I trying to call him back and an automate it machine say that I have to call from my account phone number and the driver charge me for nothing, well my babies are late for school. I decide to request another car and in the map said 4 minutes. Well I thought maybe with this other car they can make it??? The driver (**) cancel literately in front of the building and this is not the right way they do business and treat your customer. And both were late - one for school and the other to college. Good job UBER.",
0,"Uber is so much better in urban areas than my car. A local that knows the route, burn less gas, does not need to park, and gives us an explanation of town is a joy.",
0,I have used Uber many times and I have had good experiences 99% of the time. I like the convenience of the automatic payment and most of the drivers are great as well.,
0,Driver was prompt and friendly. Found out drivers rate passengers (they can alert other drivers of potentially be or aggressive riders) and passengers can rate the drivers which becomes company knowledge.,
0,"I used Uber during my stay in Las Vegas, Nevada and it was a good experience. I was taken directly to my destination and arrived right on time and Uber driver was a very friendly lady and I really enjoyed laughing and talking with her during the trip.",
0,"My first experience with Uber was taken from Seattle Airport. The vehicle was really clean and the driver was very courteous, safe driver and professional.",
1,Warning uber is a scam and there is no customer service and there drivers are drunks and drug addicts and sexual harassment,
0,"I just had a terrible experience with Uber pool. I ordered it for the first time yesterday on a route that I've taken many times before with UberX. My phone is older, so the Uber app does not allow me to see the fare before requesting an Uber pool ride. However, I'd taken this ride so many times before with UberX and the cost was never more than $50. I figured since Uber pool claims to be up to 40% cheaper that UberX and it's a shared ride, I should be fine. Boy was I wrong! I ordered the pool and waited the estimated time but didn't see the car. I received no phone call either. Finally I noticed the car a half a block down past where I was standing. I went to the car and was told to get out because he had already cancelled. I was charged a $5 cancellation fee.",
0,"I absolutely love Uber! They are very convenient, quick and for the most part very safe. I use Uber every day and I've only had a few issues which weren't that traumatic. As of this point, I don't know what I would do without Uber. I rely on them to go everywhere and in the case of needing to go to an event where it's going to be packed, with parking being horrible, Uber is a no-brainer. They drop you off close to the event, you don't have to worry about paying for a high prices parking spot. Overall, I am very happy with Uber.",
0,I've always found Uber reliable and professional nationwide. They are my go-to choice for transportation when I travel for business or pleasure.,
0,PROS: Really easy to use and fast arrival time of the car. CONS: Background check doubtful and sometimes car description is not accurate.,
1,"My driver was personable, and made me feel safe. It was good to come across a patriot rather than the grunts and groans one usually encounters with car service drivers.",
0,"The driver we had was very professional and polite and he was easy to talk to and understand. He was also nicely dressed along with being very helpful with other points of interest that we might like. Plus, he took good care of his vehicle and kept it very clean. Because of him we will be glad to try Uber again if needed.",
0,We didn't want to drive in San Francisco after parking at our hotel. We used Uber 4 times and found the response times fast and the drivers courteous and careful to obey laws. We knew about the higher prices at rush times and were not surprised at the higher but reasonable charge during the one time we rode at 5:30 pm. We will use Uber again on our trips to unfamiliar cities.,
0,New driver over 2 hours online - Trying to contact UBER is literally impossible. I was sent a delivery message which lasted approx 1 second and then disappeared. I then went on my first call and was unable to slide to commence the ride. When I did slide it I was virtually at the destination. Being unable to contact UBER to explain anything is a total waste.,
0,Uber is a great service. There are places that don't have the privilege of having buses or even a taxi for a ride. It's great for some of our citizens that need to get to doctor appointment. Uber has also provided a lot of people with jobs!,
0,"I used Uber for the first time in the Washington, DC area several months ago. My son who lives there showed me how to use the app; within just a few minutes, our ride arrived and we were safely back at our location. Waiting for public transit would have been over an hour transport time. The driver was very professional and nice.",
1,"I enjoy the cheap cost, but I feel saddened by the negative impact on the taxi drivers that have far better qualifications to drive people around. So many Uber drivers do not know the area in which they drive and are not safe drivers, often not obeying basic driving rules.",
0,"I was in L.A. and a friend had the Uber account and software on her phone so she put-in the requests. I used Uber twice (maybe three times) in L.A... They were fairly short rides that went very, very well. The drivers were very friendly and the cars they were driving were newish and clean.",
0,I ordered an Uber today @ 9:45 for a 10:00 appt I had at the doc. At first I was told to walk over two blocks to meet the driver for my convenience. I waited around 15 minutes and kept on tracking the driver but no car showed up. After thoroughly checking the entire block I found him across the street. I quickly ran over but he informed me that my ride was cancelled and I'll have to order a car again. I did and they assigned me another driver (not this one) five minutes away. That driver canceled me after five minutes. I ordered another one but he never showed. I ended up walking the 1.2 mile to my appt. I will never use Uber again. They have absolutely no reliability and no customer service. I will try Lyft in the future.,
1,"I had 4 guests (5 of us total) so ordered an Uber XL, which is advertised to seat 6 people. When I pulled up the order, I had the choice of an Uber X for $15 or an Uber XL for $35. Knowing that there would be 6 people with the driver, I ordered the Uber XL. When the car arrived, it was a small SUV (5 passenger vehicle) and the driver told us to ""squeeze in"". I have emailed Uber numerous times about this issue and have had no luck getting anything but an automated response saying that the issue has been resolved and that I should order an Uber XL for larger groups (which is what I did, but did not get an Uber XL). I have requested the $20 refund for the price difference with no success. It is not necessarily about the $20 - it is the principle. And it is also illegal for them to drive with 4 people ""squeezed in"" the back seat. It was embarrassing to me, as these were out of town guests. I do have 4 other witnesses that can verify the size of the vehicle.",
0,Used their service for a week of vacation in downtown Chicago. Drivers were always available and service was quite prompt. The drivers and vehicles were clean and they were concerned for our safety by good driving practices. Even the pickup and drop off from the USA women's soccer game in Soldiers field was accomplished to our satisfaction even though the area was crowded with spectators. The prices were very reasonable. Very satisfied with the service.,
0,"I used Uber services when I was going to a family get together. The driver was on time, polite and had good everyday conversation with me and the children.",
0,"I like the Uber app which lets me know where their cars are in proximity to my location, who my driver is, what car they are driving and when they will arrive to pick me up. I love that I do not have to tip. I get in the car and the driver already knows where I want to go. I get out as soon as we arrive and immediately get an opportunity to rate the driver. The service is great.",
1,"First time I used Uber, they were great. The second time, they got lost trying to find me (I was at a public high school) and just gave up. They texted me to cancel. Didn't even call to try to work anything out or send another driver. I won't be using them again.",
0,"I had to use Uber for a few occasions when my car needed repair. I used the app which is really convenient to use. It shows you what cars are in your local area, how close they are to your location. They show you who the driver is, and approximately how soon they can arrive. I found that my drivers were polite, good drivers. I will use them again as needed.",
0,"Uber is great for transportation for medical appointments. The call center has always been prompt and courteous with me. The drivers I've had in the past have been very caring and loyal to their customers. They were pleasant, caring, compassionate, and humorous as well. The only thing that has ever bothered me is the extensive wait time for pickup from my appointments. Uber puts more on their drivers than should be in my opinion. I have personally seen the stress and anxiety in the drivers.",
0,"Not a real frequent user, but every experience the same. Close by, on time, good drivers, nice conversation if we initiate, safe to destination, no problem at the end of the ride.",
0,It's an economic and convenient service. I like the convenience of the app and being able to track just where my driver is. I've never had any situations that I felt were unsafe or threatening.,
0,I started using UBER while on vacation in Arizona a couple years ago. Took it to and from the airport. I was shocked on how easy it was! I LOVE that there is no money that exchanges hands at all. I was a little leery about providing my credit card info when I signed up but I've never had a problem. I've used UBER so many times since then in different places... Like Chicago! It's just so much cheaper than a cab plus the drivers are usually very friendly and like to tell you about different places to visit (if you're a tourist). Recently I was on a trip to San Francisco and used UBER the whole time. Something new I learned about while there was UBER POOL. The driver picks up a number of people at different stops and drops everyone off at their pre-determined destination and it was only $4.99 per trip because you are sharing a ride with others. Very cool!,
1,"There were two representatives for Uber at Westfield mall in Escondido yesterday, one ** one **. The ** man was staring at women's behind as they walked by! That was offensive for me to see and I let the ** man know it. He said ""Thank you"" and he would take care of it but man come on!!! What do you think he is like when he is alone with female passengers!!!",
0,"Uber began as a very reputable alternative to other livery services, however, that has changed. Rates are quoted as one amount and billed higher. The drivers are miserable, some of them actually hit their female customers. Uber's customer service is literally non-existent and with the exception of booking a car, all of their online services are at best horrible.",
0,"Uber is great as long as you are traveling by yourself or with someone over age 4. If you're a single mom with a baby there are ZERO cars that offer baby seats. You are expected to lug a seat with you which is horrible if you are trying to go out shopping or something. You can't exactly lug around a giant car seat. Single moms need an option too. There also aren't many women drivers, I have only seen one.",
1,"Rates are very reasonable. Pickup times are pretty prompt. However, sometimes they come early then charge for wait time and a few times I had to wait on them. Cars are usually very clean and comfortable. Drivers are not always chatty so it depends on preference if you like to talk or not, BUT they are concentrating on GPS etc. One driver I had didn't stop for stop signs and he must have thought the signs said ROLL.",
0,"Uber sucks big time and simply laugh at all complaints. They only care about making money, at the expense of the drivers and riders. Uber should be put out of business permanently.",
0,Same of your drivers have different things in their car. All drivers should care some extra things but I have always been happy with the service.,
1,"I've used Uber many times in the past but I would never use Uber now! Many times I have been billed for rides where the driver literally drove right by me, and I'd have to call for another ride. You are automatically billed $5 if you miss your pickup. INSANITY! The procedure to get your $5 back that has literally been stolen from you is so time-consuming. It simply isn't worth the bother. I already had an unsatisfactory opinion of Uber - before all the HORRIBLENESS that they are today, June 13th 2017... So I'd say, try to catch a Lyft with someone else!",
0,"My granddaughter and I ordered an uber from santa monica beach pier . Three drivers cancelled and I was charged for the third one with them stating that the driver waited over 2 minutes for me. I was at the pickup point long before I ever contacted this driver. He evidently left  and charged me with a cancellation fee and I followed the rules. Uber has shown to a very shadowy company from the get go. From now on, I will be a customer of Lyft! I have disputed this with the BBB, no response from uber so now I am making you aware.",
0,"I suddenly became very ill at work. I usually take the bus home, but was too ill to do that. I got on my phone and saw that many Uber vehicles were already circling my block at work, so a vehicle arrived promptly, before I could even come down on the elevator. The driver was a woman who was a previous healthcare worker, and she assured me that I could relax, and not to worry. If I got sick she could take care of me. Talk about customer service! She was so kind, I immediately felt better.",
0,"Both Uber vehicles were not clean, old and uncomfortable. Although no tip was required I offered and they accepted. Not overly pleased with the rides.",
0,"I started using Uber about four months ago. My first two rides went perfectly. I was able to state where I was located, as well as the two locations that I wanted to go to. However, the third time that I wanted to use Uber, I was no longer able to put in two locations, just one. I didn't realize that at that point, and only realized it once a driver was driving me to my primary location. My driver was amazing enough to drive me to my second location; as thanks for this, I paid him with the few dollars that I had in my wallet.",
1,Uber is very convenient and reasonable. I have used it often and have only been disappointed once. That time the driver took a longer route to my house. I rated the driver low and Uber contacted me right away and modified my trip charge!,
0,"The first time I used Uber was in SF. Several times they were fantastic, then NYC that was not as great but still very good. Just took longer in NYC and not as friendly.",
0,"Uber is great because I have used it in India, Singapore and got great rates in the US too. They have special deals and I wish they had more of those because it makes it so much competitive with the mass transit.",
0,"Uber is a scam and a pyramid scheme! They always find new and ingenious ways to rip off their drivers, riders and even their own employees. I hope they crash and burn.",
1,"When my wife died a few states away the Sunday before Thanksgiving 2016, I needed to get home to NJ. They were awful at Newark Airport. Some drivers came ""disguised"" as UBER drivers and would not take me where I NEEDED to go. Nor were some of them UBER drivers to begin with. 2 Drivers put me & luggage in car, pulled away from EWR, asked where to, heard where to and said, ""Sorry, get out."" They are never available in Suburbia late at night and very early AM.",
0,"Terrible experience with Uber service today. The rider Roger, Chrysler 300, 7LHV109 accepted my ride request but never showed up and ignored my calls and text messages. My App showed he was sitting near a shopping plaza a mile away instead of picking me up. After 35 minutes in the heat, my cell phone died and I had to take a taxi. Terrible service! And Uber charged me money for its driver's failure!",
0,"The Uber drivers that we used were OK. One was creepy and the other two ladies were nice. The one thing they all had in common, they were SLOW. They drive way below the speed limit and I felt like I was never going to get to my destination.",
0,"I have used Uber all over the world and it has always been prompt and convenient, as well as cheaper than a standard taxi. The drivers have always been polite and some have also been more friendly. I do have reservations about many aspects of the so-called gig economy and feel a little guilty when I use services such as Uber, but I cannot fault the service I have received as a customer.",
0,"I've taken Uber only half a dozen times, and all but one were pleasant experiences. The unpleasant experience went beyond the pale however. I probably could have contacted Uber during the ride and I'm sure arrangements would have been made to care for the problem, as their customer service has always been stellar. All told, Uber has been a lifesaver on those occasions I didn't want to drive.",
0,I have used Uber as a passenger and I am a part-time driver with them. I get outstanding rating and comments from my passengers. I would like to see more of the drivers I get also really care about the passenger they are transporting (me).,
0,"For the most part, Uber is convenient and fast. Need a way to tip. 1 driver with road rage, but very much the exception. Still way better vetting than taxis.",
0,"This was one old, small, worn out Uber vehicle for an hour trip to the airport. Ft Collins to Denver airport. But the driver was friendly and drove safely.",
0,Used Uber while in Boston MA. Driver was excellent and knew his way around during peak driving time after work. We used Uber 3 times and always got to our destination on time.,
0,"I have used Uber many times, and each time I have been exceedingly pleased. The drivers were prompt, courteous, and professional. I highly recommend Uber.",
0,"Great for the rider, they get quick service. Poor pay for the drivers due to a flooded market. No concern given to the fact that if you hire too many drivers there will not be enough riders to make the trips worth your time and fuel.",
0,"The experience with Uber is entirely dependent on the driver. One driver took excellent care of me while another driver almost left me off miles from my destination in an industrial park, not a hotel. I threatened to call the police.",
0,"Please, please use Lyft or a cab service. Uber is just awful. I had a driver verbally abuse me this morning, so I asked Uber for a full refund. They gave me a $5 credit, and basically said they don't think my situation warrants a full refund. Clearly this company supports abusive drivers over their customers. I will NEVER be using their services again.",
1,"I was picked up from my workplace on 30/8/2017 at around 8:56 pm by cab no. TN 07 CE 8554. The trip started on my account but the drivers account was not updated. navigation kept directing the driver to my pick up point. finally after taking a full circle and wasting my time he called up customer service. the executive directed him to cancel my ongoing trip and ask me to book another assuring that the same cab will be assigned. the driver cancelled and when i booked again i was assigned a ride 20 min away. the driver asked me to get off on the street amidst a downpour. when i refused to get off away from my pick up point, while it was raining and demanded to talk to customer service again, the driver called up the office again but refused to let me speak. customer service executive told him to tell me that i am not being charged for the trip so get off. I have never seen such behavior in my life. the moment you undertake the responsibility of a trip, you are taking responsibility for our time, safety and good service delivery and in return take payment from us. you cannot waste our time, compromise our safety and then put us through discomfort and finally say 'ok we won't charge you this time'. looks like uber is no better than a bunch of scoundrels with no work ethics or standards.",
1,"I left my phone in the Uber. I could not log in to my account because Uber needs multi factor authentication, meaning they were sending codes to the lost phone. *facepalm*. Because why else would I need to log into my Uber account from another device... So I tracked my phone to its location. Politely asked for my phone back and was refused. Though it was not the driver that picked me, he also ""just happened"" to be another Uber driver.",
0,"I just wanted to write and let all of you at Uber that I had the most amazing driver the other day! As soon as I got in the car, he handed me a bowl of delicious treats, I thought that was so sweet! Then he handed me a bottle of water.  This may not be a big deal to some, however, it actually made my day! He was so polite, helpful, generous and all around awesome!!! Please please let this driver, Jasur Nazarou # 5756433 know that he is awesome!! He deserves some sort of praise from all of you at Uber! All of your drivers should take notes from this guy! All of your drivers need to be like him!!! WONDEEFUL EXPERIENCE!!!!Stephanie Angelini  @Angelinistephanie.  *****@yahoo.com.",
0,"Car went to wrong address. Was filthy. Charged me 3 x the estimate!!!!!! Never again. Crap, crap, crap, crap.",
0,I had to request a pickup several times since the drivers were waiting for it to be midnight for the price surge. They were cancelling my pickup and I was getting charged for the cancellation. The next day the driver said she couldn't find me although the next driver had no issues. I was again charged a cancellation fee. The unprofessional driver hung up on me when I was giving specific directions trying to make it easier to find me. I was visiting LA and staying in Santa Monica. These experiences somewhat soured my trip.,
0,She continually amazed me with her skill and expertise on the road. She was very kind and courteous and knew every possible avenue of travel. Props to Uber for their fine selection.,
0,"I will never understand why the drivers of the self driving UBER CAR in Tempe Arizona. Are not drugged tested, I know a few that would test positive. How could UBER put the risk of peoples, lives at risk. Also open their self up for a huge lawsuit.",
0,I recently took an Uber and was checking my trips the next day and see that I was being charged a cleaning fee of $150. My driver's name was Michael and picked me up in Delray Beach Florida and dropped me off in Boca Raton Florida. The ride cost $18.42. When I asked Uber through the Uber help I was advised I was being charged a cleaning fee. I then received pictures of vomit that was on the seat and the floor. This was something that I absolutely did not do. I have asked that the community manager in my area call me and I have not received any response. These pictures that were submitted were not from me. I feel violated and feel nothing I can do but dispute these charges with my bank.,
0,"I requested an UberX, and was told he'd arrived, ""Will ** (Willie)""... I made my way outside only to find him gone. I checked my App to see if he'd canceled, only to find that I was ""on my way"". How could that be, if I was still home. I emailed Uber about this situation, Harsh ** asked for details. I responded providing screenshots, and after 3 hours of waiting and hearing nothing, I was told they wouldn't be issuing a refund because based on the trip details, it ""looks like the trip took place""... SMH, WTF. I even offered to provide a picture of myself, and asked them to contact the driver about whom he picked up, but to no avail. Thoroughly disgusted with Uber.",
1,"I never knew there is going to be such difficult task to contact Uber's customer service about an issue me and my husband had. In fact there is no customer service per se but a critical safety response line which wasn't much of the help in our problem. What happened is that my husband left in Uber his wallet with all his documents, id cards, credit cards, pictures etc. He really got stressed out about it a lot, we contacted Uber through an app right away as we were not able to reach the driver. You must know that you really can't reach the driver even though the Uber app would transfer your call to him. The driver never picked up his phone nor there was a voicemail set up so we could leave a message. From Saturday night until Monday night we didn't know anything about the lost wallet. At least he could call back or e-mail us that he found or didn't find it.",
0,"I finally caved and opened an account with UBER in order to take a ride from Hallandale to the Fort Lauderdale Airport to fly home. I was under the impression that the first ride was free, but I could not find the place to enter the code. Nevertheless, I was picked up and dropped off for a charge of $17.94. Once at the gate, I thought I would go back into the app and learn about it, and perhaps discover where to enter promo codes. That's when I saw that a second charge of $97.94 had been applied. To make a long story short, and after a number of back and forth emails with UBER, it seems that my driver Yuniel, who could not speak a word of English, claimed that my dog (which I do not have) had urinated all over his seats. The UBER reply after the fourth email included photos.",
0,"I live in San Francisco (city) and have been using Uber for about two years. About six months ago I had the first issue with two drivers that I had to report for violations. My score has always been 5 stars until then, but Uber is allowing drivers to leave a negative rating for riders that have reported them or left a negative feedback due to unprofessional, rude, dangerous behavior. My score dropped to 4.85 because of that. Yesterday afternoon I correctly and honestly paid for two seats (me and my spouse), and when the driver arrived the car only had one seat available. When we asked him to cancel the ride, he denied our request multiple times and stared at us in a creepy way. When he heard we were going to contact Uber immediately, he left us on the sidewalk with bags and kept on making us pay for a ride we weren't benefitting of.",
0,"I ordered an Uber to get to an interview in Tempe and I live in Gilbert. I had the same Uber drive to and from the interview... David. On the ride there he charged me the normal amount. Then on the way back he charged me an extra 50$ for an ""accident"" in the car. There was no accident I was at an interview! I would love to know what I did. They make up accidents so that they can make more money. It is ridiculous. This is one of the worst company's to use. DO NOT USE THEM. Use lyft they are way more trustworthy and will not cheat you and take your money!",
0,"I was recently in Seattle for a fun trip. Used Uber several times without a problem. But then all of a sudden they charged me $250 out of nowhere to which they never did respond. But thank God my bank denied that fee. Then I asked for a ride, they cancelled on me, yet said I was not at the location I requested, then charged me $5 for a cancelled ride, NOT!!! And trying to contact customer service is a joke, to say the least. I have not used Lyft yet but will now be checking that out. Uber is a big rip off be careful out there!!!",
0,The drivers are rude and refuse to come at the pickup location _ Drivers Name : Kamaljeet PB 01A5756. They have an excuse of getting charged for the parking lot. as well when asked to come at pick location straight away says no. Another person in the que is Baldev with Car number,

1,"ON 7/30/17 I was in Oregon alone on a trip at the University needing a ride to PDX to get home to CA. I chose Uber over Lyft because they had a driver available and the time of arrival worked for me, I was to arrive at 5:11 to the airport PDX which would have been plenty of time. But with him getting lost to me looking for gas. And me having to use the app to guide him to my pick up locations I ended up being 45minutes late which therefore made me miss my plane. I'm sorry. This is unacceptable from Uber, feeling helpless at the time and that was not what I was quoted. My time that you gave me was to ARRIVE at 5:11 to PDX that gave me 1:35 min to catch my flight I WAS 45 minutes late!",
0,I feel compelled to let people know they are not the only one seeing hidden charges show up after a ride. I recently was in Boston and actually ran down the street to get in the car early so the driver did not have to stop up further in heavier traffic and was charged a wait time charge? How the heck does that work? No response from Uber yet as just wrote to them. The driver was very nice and a good ride to my destination but that fee is so pumped up just to make more money and I was right at the door of the address I put in that Uber agreed to pick me up at for $14 ride.,
0,"I contacted Uber for a ride, August 2, 2017, at about 9:00 PM. The first was a no show. The driver notified me that he could not pick me up. But, I was charged a $5.00 fee! Could not contact Uber to protest this charge. I will never use Uber again.",
0,"I have only been able to successfully use the app once. Whenever I have tried to get a ride it says ""check your connection"". It never seems to have a problem with my connection when it comes to excessively texting me messages, urging me to become a driver or remembering my credit card information. I never requested info to become a driver, only a rider. When I went online to contact ""customer service"", my only option was to fill in a generic field box.",
0,It's August 2nd here in Dallas Texas and it is raining very hard. I called for an Uber ride to go to an ortho appointment that I have at Parkland Hospital. I was involved in horrific accident in January and my leg was nearly severed and it was saved from being amputated. I've been in a wheelchair for months today was my first to leave the house without a wheelchair or a walker to go to an appointment. It was pouring rain and the driver pulled up.,
0,"I had good experience with almost 50% of the drivers but some can be very dishonest. I Had to use Uber a lot during the month of May/June 2017 due to and accident that prevented me from driving.
Case #1: The driver charged me 100% more of the initial fare. He reported we were more than 4 riders. Not true. We were just my husband and I. After many claims from my part Uber eventually refunded me.
Case #2: The driver reported that we changed the destination address. Not true. He charged 100% more of the initial fare. Uber never refunded me.
Case #3: The driver charged me 100% more of the initial fare. She reported that I didn't provide the correct destination address. I explained to her that it must have been a system glitch. I was late for the appointment with my doctor because of that. She reported me to Uber as if I made racial discrimination remarks. NOT TRUE. I contacted Uber and demanded a meeting with the driver to clarify that offensive report. Uber never was able to sustain the driver's claim and eventually they opted to ignore my messages. Very disappointing experience.
I might use Uber in the future but I'll be very cautious checking the charges before I leave the car after the service. And I would advice to customers to do the same.",
0,"I am an active user of Uber and so, when I saw the service was available in France during my recent vacation, I used Uber rather than a taxi. I left my iPhone in an Uber last Thursday in Bordeaux. I immediately tried to log in to my account and contact the driver but apparently, because I was in another country, they required I provide a verification code - which was sent to my phone, which was in the Uber driver's car. My friend, who is also an Uber user, contacted Uber through her app to file an inquiry on my behalf. We have no less than 10 emails from Uber customer service, a different person each time, asking me/her to file an inquiry online - which would always lead to the service sending a verification code to the phone.",
0,"In Kadubeesanahalli at 11.00 AM on 31/07/2017, in front of 'Prestige Tech Park' the Uber driver hit my vehicle from right side. I stepped down to find out why he did that. I asked him ""when there is lot of space why you hit my car?"" He replied saying, ""I want to go to the left edge of the road immediately so I hit your vehicle. If I hit your vehicle you will stop so I can go the left edge of the road to drop my passengers."" This is how the Uber drivers are. Uber is encouraging and teaching their drivers to hit and kill people in order to drop their passengers on time. We are on one way road. He at least does not know that it is one way. He says ""this is two way so I can go to any direction that I want."" Very strange people on earth. This is how the social responsibility of the Uber is. Great organization.",
0,Requested a Uber in Las Vegas.  Was standing in front of the Uber designated pickup spot for hotel when ordered Uber.  Contacted driver after waiting 25 minutes.  He said I was at wrong spot hung up on me and cancelled my pickup and charged me.  Uber refuses to refund that charge.  I've contacted them several times and they send me the exact generic email saying no refund.  Horrible customer service will never use Uber again.,
1,"My first time experience with Uber was objectionable!  Signed up as a first time rider with Uber under a promotion called Chase50.  Offer was for 50% off for first timers for the first 2 trips thru July 31, 2017.  Had a difficult time to get the first one honored and the second one was lamely refused.  Their app is terrible!  It willl not allow a promotion code to be accepted.  Communication thru the app is rigid and tortuous and the usual 800 number in the charges description won't allow any  incoming calls only refers you back to their app which is worthless. And to top it all the second driver's conduct and dress code was second rate to put it mildly.  Thank goodness for Lyft which I have been using all along without any problems whatsoever.  Their driver's professionalism is top rate.   Even their promotions are automatic.  I will erase Uber app not to use them ever again.",
1,My uber driver stole my money out of my account. 47 dollars. His name was Michael. License plate **. Be careful he will charge you extra. My ride came up to 7 dollars and they will make up things to take out money out of your account. Uber is very unprofessional.,
0,"I'm driving for uber, of course as idea uber is a very unique company but bottom line it is taxi company. Only in taxi companies drivers may be non professionals but in uber company I can't see anything that american. Number one being unique company it's not enough to be the great company, and bet is very dirty cheating company, and they cheat not only customers, they cheat drivers, and that automatically mean they cheat government. I warn every customer, driver check your trips mileage and time and compare with charges and you will be surprised that is not matching reality, some small some big but it will be different. Even small different is cheating and if you may multiply that cheating to quantity of trips daily it will be millions, monthly will be billions. Is this is American way? I don't think so.",
0,I waited at the same spot at the airport. Car was 7 minutes away. I waited for 15 minutes until the car arrived. Yet Uber charged me waiting time!! The charge was very small but this is a question of principle and honesty. Is this due to improper reporting by driver and if so how can I correct this erroneous reporting. If it is Uber making a mistake how can I get this corrected? It is very difficult to contact Uber about customer issues. I have been an avid Uber rider but from now on I will look for other options.,
1,I used the Uber ride and secured Uber pool for the price of $18 and change. When I receive the receipt for the ride it was for $22 and change. I contacted Uber about the error and they insisted the price on the receipt was correct. This was clearly a case of price switching that Uber does not want to take responsibility for. Not to mention that the driver got lost several times using Uber's map system and I had to use the google app on my phone to get the driver pointed in the correct direction. Uber customer service was absolutely no help in this incident at all.,
0,I have had several recent issues with Uber. I requested an Uber in New Orleans and the driver never showed up. I followed the route and according to the driver they picked my husband and I up and dropped us off at our destination. This did NOT happen. We never received our ride but were charged for the ride nonetheless. When I contacted Uber about being charged but not receiving the ride they stated that the driver checked in and said the ride was given. We were left stranded and never received the ride.,
0,"I was going on vacation and called Uber, the driver showed up. I opened the door to acknowledge him and start to take out the suitcase. Before I took out the first suitcase the driver left and then charged me a fee. The second driver showed up and said he didn't know how to get to the airport so he too left and charged a fee. Finally I called Lyft and they showed up. However, they kept charging my card while I was in Scandinavia.",
0,"Driver Gurvinder ( car Tata Indica phone number *******861)in Chandigarh charged me Rs 401.51 instead of Rs 74.27.I entered the correct location and I was following the GPS till the drop off. And I was wondering how the driver changed the location because it was correct till he dropped me off. driver somehow changed it after that and charged me extra. This isn't fair- please check driver's phone or how he did it. And he didn't show me that he completed the trip and Once I got out of the car he did something on his phone. Same time I thought that something was wrong . now I can't trust Uber at all.
They charged me four times the fare I was supposed to pay and they didn't even confirmed me .I was shocked to see the email of 401Rs.
That's ridiculous. I have been doing lot of Uber rides but now onwards I want to tell everyone to keep a check on uber drivers in India.
This is very bad experience from uber. I thought Uber drivers were honest - didn't expect this at all.",
0,Driver passed me up then showed her on her way back then all of a sudden nothing. By cancelling it wanted to charge me 5.00$. Lost a ton of time and now I have to miss work. Because I didnt pick up my car before closing. Your driver just cost me a days work. Not happy!!! Lic plate#**.,
0,"I'm so sick of the ** Uber drivers, rude and disgusting attitude. We pay them and they have the nerve to have an attitude. Some of them have terrible driving skills to say the least. I asked a couple drivers if I could go run inside a location and come right out and go back to my home address which is basically a round trip. One of them told me yes. I came out after literally one minute 30 seconds and his ass was gone. Like who does that?? That is super inconvenient especially when booking another Uber just to get home in the middle of rush hour. On top of that it's $5 just to even get in the Uber before you even pull off. That's terrible.",
0,"There is an uber driver here in St. Pete that is a drug user and dealer; he offered me marijuana and or pills.  He was high, his eyes were glassy and glazed-over he and his car had the stench of marijuana. He also offered rides off the app and is a go between for an escort. Mark gukpm",
0,An uber was called to bring my friends home. He heard them argue the entire way home it's a friend that she was trying leave. He then proceeded to pick the same girl up and take her to the airport. As several of us told him not to take her because she was drunk.,
0,"Wasn't aware of their ""SURGE"" pricing, otherwise known as PRICE GOUGING. It seems if you request a ride when they're busy, you are charge more (a lot more!). I was charged 18.35 for 3/4 of a mile ride under 5 minutes. Driver said Uber does not share the inflated price with them.",

I was so upset when I saw 341.00 for the total this am!!!!!This is wrong and law suit worthy.  They need to make it very clear for the tired and apparently not bright to make a person realize that they will be stolen from a ludicrous amount.  I am going to file a complaint with the better business bureau and refuse to ever use them again. And they don't make it easy at all to complain on there site.

1,"Tried to use them to get to the airport in S. Francisco. First driver showed up and told us he didn't have a permit to get to the airport, so we had to get another, then the price went up from $29 to over $40 in less than 2 mins. I was charged for 'cancelling'. Odd since I am a first time user and it wasn't my fault! Thought I would give them another chance at National Airport DC. Driver could barely speak English, could not tell me how much the ride would be because he said ""Uber set the price. I don't know how much."" WILL NEVER EVER BOTHER WITH UBER. I hope they don't last much longer. They are terrible, no way to contact anyone. I was charged TWO cancellation fees, would like a refund but good luck with that. Completely disgraceful treatment of its customers.",
0,"I was ripped off for $150 for cleaning fee. After a night out, I call uber and got a ride home. I got in the front seat and got home within 12 minutes. The ride is about $7. I got a receipt for about $7. I have no idea the driver file a charge of $150 for cleaning until I look in my credit card bill. I never received the receipt for the $150 until I complain to uber. Apparently, my driver file a cleaning fee to my ride with pictures of the middle back seat being wet and a little mess. I was sitting in the front seat. And if I don't get an alert that the charge was going to tag on, where is the avenue where I can contest this charge. The mess could have been made by the previous rider or the driver lied and file s false report. But if I don;'t get the alert right away, there is no way for me to contest this. That's why this is a scam. I will suggest all rider to take pictures of the interior of the car before leaving the car. Just to be safe so that you don't get rape by Uber.",

1,My wife took UBER with my 3 years old son from MALDEN MA to EAST BOSTON MA to a clinic. When they get there my son throw up a little bit. He only drinks milk. He does not eat any food and even his doctor knows that he does not eat any food so my wife grab some baby wipes and clean most of it but the driver was rushing her and he told her DON'T WORRY. He never told my wife that she will end up paying anything.,

0,"I use my cards all over the world and have relied on taxis. My friends were telling me to try Uber so I did. The driver was great. However my payment wasn't accepted. The only customer service is by email which is more annoying than an IVR system. You get a response but you can tell it is either automated with the just the names changed or it is a copy and paste. There is no customer in their service. It's like speaking to a robot. I normally don't work with any company that doesn't have a customer service phone number and display it on their website, but I tried Uber because of the recommendations. After a couple of back and forth emails, they finally asked me to send photocopies of documents which further annoyed me. I probably won't use Uber again. I will take a taxi.",

1,I requested a ride at 7:45pm I  could see the driver on the map never leave his home. The driver calls me and tells me he is outside my home when I knew he wasn't I called back and the driver was very rude he was very rude I hate to say it but mostly all every African drivers I get from uber are rude and they always have an attitude. The driver told me he was not coming to pick me and hung on me I was then charged a cancellation fee when the driver was the one that cancelled the trip. I never have this issue with lyft uber needs to get better drivers I will not be taking another uber i will use lyft or walk to my destination. I find it ridiculous I have to deal with someone rude when they are getting paid to drive me around.,
1,I was quoted $17 and when I entered the car the driver added a seat which raised my fare. He then did the same to the passenger who shared my ride. He denied it both times. Uber simply responded to me that I would be given a quote before entering which I was and still doesn't resolve my issue. The driver is scamming passengers. They don't track how often he is doing this?!?,
0,"Most of customers are complaining about drivers being unprofessional because they passed nearby customer when the driver just received the request. The real thing is that Drivers are not responsible for SOFTWARE ISSUES!!! Uber is responsible for that. Uber need to adjust the software for server to pick up riders 3-4 minutes before arriving near customer, but because the programmers are following the UBER RULE to be aggressive taking very fast the customers, they cant solve real problems to pick up customers in a right order so no one cant mistake anything!! Like in a dual carriageway, server dont think that you need to turn around. ",

I see this as a problem because someone's child could be meeting up with a predator and end up dead somewhere... run away from home, etc. Nashville has got to do better and not just be concerned about making money. Be concerned about child safety.",

First of all the driver obviously didn't know what avenue to take even after I told him. 1 hour to get to midtown... pure BS. And why was it sooo expensive. Because the base fare is $7.00 and then $13.16 for 3.51 miles and then $31.51 for the 49 minutes that I wasted in the damn car. Grand total $51.67. Never again... And I would advise everyone to stay away from Uber if you don't want to get ripped off!!!,
1,"Up until 2 days ago, I had been an Uber partner for over a year and must say their practices are very questionable. 1st point, DRIVERS. How can a company claim they do ""background"" checks, and on countless occasions have the drivers be a bunch of menacing idiots, providing questionable rides in even more questionably safe cars, all the while being more focused on his/her phone conversation than the road. SERIOUSLY?! Now if these checks were, in fact, being done, then why the battle for not allowing drivers to be fingerprinted? It's an honest question, and quite frankly, a legit one. You claim your drivers are safe, but are unwilling to back that up with something so simple as fingerprinting?! LET THE BUYER BEWARE! ",

The driver was irritating kept asking how long have you been in Chicago. He had phone in one hand and was driving with the other and kept missing the direction even though it was clear on his cell phone on he route we were taking. I will think twice before requesting an Uber because a Cab provides me with better experience then Uber",
0,"hi
Good to have your services in share too and for the last two days i am enjoying my to and fro rides , with competitive rates .
  you have clubbed me with another rider who was in a different direction
for eg.;;   my (second) booking was from Income Tax towers, AC Guards to Manikonda  which is of some 13 kms plus
     In the first booking , the cab's destination was Janapriya Utopia via  Attapur Road 
 And then he drove me from towards langar houz and proceeded to nekhnampur from there to Manikonda, nearly covering some 20 kms in the traffic.  
These two designations are poles apart.  Ofcourse sharing is always time consuming.  I do agree    
But that should also be properly connected in the same route or beyond one destination or may extend to the bye lanes.
Definitely that cannot be coupled with this type of  two different directions , that too in this hyderabad traffic in the peak hours.  
So my advice is to refine the connectivity so that there will be more no. of commuters And again on second occasion, today you have clubbed me with another who travels to entirely a different destinationToday also the same thing happened 
you have clubbed customers travelling in two different routes thereby causing chaos between us and good amount of delay in the travel.  I picked up at 9.00 
IF YOU POOL CUSTOMERS TOGETHER WITH DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.  Really this is not expected from you 
YOU WILL BE A FAILURE IN UBER POOL
GO DOWN MY BOOKING HISTORY AND ESPECIALLY TODAY'S ROUTE AND IF YOU HAVE ANY CONCERN FOR CUSTOMERS TRAVELLING IN POOL, YOU WILL NEVER RESORT LIKE THIS
This is my second mail.  and which i expect turn a new leaf
If you dont improve,  your efforts of pooling will go unnoticed

0,"I've had countless issues with uber drivers claiming false cancellations, claiming to have picked me up when they hadn't, etc. Tonight a guy picked me up and immediately started hinting that I lived too far away. Mid way through the ride he finally concluded that I did,in fact, live too far away (he just wasn't familiar with the New York area at ALL- NO, Brooklyn isn't in Manhattan). He kicked me out of the car in the middle of the night in a bad neighborhood and cancelled the ride. I had to walk with my three heavy bags all the way home because of other issues with false cancellations and uber. Lyft isn't much better but fewer terrible experiences for sure.",

When I requested the Uber driver I saw that he has 4 out of 5 stars and figured he would be a good driver. 
    However, the driver seemed to be lost and had no clue where he was. He passed my street four times, which my street is not that difficult to find! He kept making U-turns and turning down the wrong streets. 
   For a driver, you're suppose to know where you're going! And if you don't know, follow the GPS! It was an awful experience that I had with Uber. I had to pay an outrageous price for parking at the airport and was late for my flight! If the driver just knew where he was going or knew how to use a GPS then this issue wouldn't be an issue!
    Since I canceled the Uber ride they want to charge me for a cancelation fee! Uber really needs to test their drivers to see if they're smart enough to use a GPS. Although, you'd think it would be common knowledge... I guess not.",

Another driver had no idea how to get to the airport that was 15 minutes away and took a route that took over an hour and I was almost late for my flight.  Be wary travelers!",
0,"I have noticed in the past months a serious decline in Uber service. Drivers are incredibly unprofessional. For example, today I was late to work so I requested an Uber. A driver accepted my request and the app showed he was just 3 minutes away. As I am waiting, I see the car move away from my location instead of closer. I call the driver, who tells me he is coming around. After waiting another 8 minutes, and seeing he is indeed coming around, he suddenly- and for no reason - cancels the trip when he is just a half block away. ",
1,Noticed activity on my iPhone today saying that my Uber ride was en route - well that was interesting as I was working from home and had not called Uber so I cancelled it without thinking anything was wrong. Went to drive my car to yoga and a new message comes up about my Uber driver is en route! Now I am curious so I go into my account and see that there were several rides since midnight - one for nearly $500. the interesting part was they were in Detroit and I am in Atlanta and had not been to Detroit in over six months and I always rent a car when there. In any case I send a message that I think there has been fraudulent activity and briefly explain what is going on - no response nothing! So I call the driver that is supposedly picking me up and tell him that I am in ATL that this is a fraudulent ride - he hangs up on me. ,
1,"I was at the airport and figured I would try Uber ..first guy ..we went around in circles 
Trying to navigate the map.. I don't
Know where I am at the airport they say you can contact the driver or text I couldn't
Second driver same thing ..you would think one of them would call me they could see I was still standing lost ..never ever again at least real cab drivers call you and let you know where to go and where they can meet you.. I hope they do not charge
Me doe those two cancelations that would be the icing on the cake.. Uber you suck
Bigtime",
0,"A few week ago my boyfriend had ordered me an uber ride home. It was very late, and when I had gotten in the cab, the driver seemed really aloof and tired. I was very courteous, asked him how his night was, and the response I got was very groggy and rude. Regardless he started driving and when he hit over 50mph in a 25mph school zone, I started getting a bit uncomfortable and concerned. I asked politely if he could slow down and again, he answered with a rude tone of voice.
A few days go by and I get a call from my boyfriend asking why he was charged $165.00 !!!!! The driver had accused me of vomiting in his car!!! And took ""fake photos"" and sent them to uber! It was appalling! And the photos he took looked like a crime seen it was so disgusting. It looked liked mushy popcorn and water, and the guy even went so far to smear it all over his car. Was just so gross. 
Never in my life have I thrown up in someone's taxi cab, and if I had felt sick, I would have politely told the man to pull over. I was not sick, I was not drunk, and I remember the ride clearly. Nothing along those lines had happened and I am shocked uber let him get away with something so terrible. Not only did he accuse an innocent passanger, but tried to steal money from my boyfriends account. TERRIBLE!!!!!",
0,"Uber did not get my payment because the credit card was outdated. I would like to solve the matter but have not been able to do this on line. I am not going to spend 10 hours on line trying to figure this out since I am not that technical. A number to reach Uber would be nice.
The only reason I gave 3 stars was because the driver was great. Customer service??????????...There is absolutely no customer service!!!..really..none! You will never ever be able to speak to anyone. If your question is not in their category of FAQ's then forget it. So how does that make you feel as a customer?  Sounds to me like they don't want to talk to the people who are making their business grow. They are now on my do not call list.",
0,"This past Friday, May 13, 2016 at 4:40 p.m., I wanted to try the new UBER app to order a car. It was raining and I am disabled. I followed all the instructions on the APP 1. pickup location 224 West 57 Street & Broadway 2) destination, Sheepshead Bay Brooklyn. etc. and they sent me the name of the driver and you can see how far away he is from your location. I was waiting for the price of the ride which I thought should be automatically; some kind of confirmation number so I can have the option to not accept the car. The driver came and I figured he would know, as soon as I told him where I had to go, he was complaining that the trip was too far, a lot of traffic for Friday and it is raining. I asked him how much is the ride. He had no idea, but he kept saying to me it is an estimated price. There is no set price. That was not what I expected, so I asked what will the estimate be he said up to $200.00 due to the rain, heavy traffic. ",
0,"I took a 13.00 fare to pick up a car for my company. I had all of my stuff, which included 2 phones. As soon as the driver left I realized I forgot 1 of the phones which I with android device manager while emailing both he and Uber support 7 times each over the course of the next hour. The driver answered his phone once and obviously knew I was calling about my phone as the Uber automated system tells him that when it auto calls. He hung up and then did not answer again for another hour. Uber responded back with ""wait a while"". After the hour of trying I texted and left a VM that simply said, ""I know you have my phone because I can see it on GPS, please call me back."" Well this moron obviously is not aware of gps technology and probably figured he was caught so he called me back. The conversation was unintelligible as he repeated over and over that he wasn't in my city any longer and couldn't get right back. ",

0,"I have been made late to work twice because of this. The first time, my driver wouldn't take me to my destination because ""he didn't have time"". I was informed of this immediately after getting in his car. I asked him ""Why would you accept the fare without checking where the passenger is going first?"" He couldn't speak English well enough to answer me. Another time I had a driver refuse to get on the highway (highway takes 15 minutes for me to get to work, back roads takes 30,35) despite me repeatedly telling him he was going to make me late for work. He didn't just answer me and just kept pointing to the map on his phone. I've taken this same trip literally a couple hundred times, and this was the only time a driver did not take the highway.

1,UBER charged my checking account debit card fraudulently. This caused a huge upset with the family and overdrew our checking account. We were harmed by this.

I have been trying to reach out to her through Uber help for five days and she refuses to respond which leads me to believe she has stolen the tablet. Uber does not have anything in place for drivers that keep items left behind by customers nor do they have anything in place that drivers refuse to respond after Uber reaches out to them.

1,UBER charged my checking account debit card fraudulently. This caused a huge upset with the family and overdrew our checking account. We were harmed by this.

I have been trying to reach out to her through Uber help for five days and she refuses to respond which leads me to believe she has stolen the tablet.

It was obvious from the route map after something had gone wrong. Obvious from the time taken for the journey. Obvious from the 33%higher charge than the estimate.

0,"I have been made late to work twice because of this. The first time, my driver wouldn't take me to my destination because ""he didn't have time"". I was informed of this immediately after getting in his car. I asked him ""Why would you accept the fare without checking where the passenger is going first?"" He couldn't speak English well enough to answer me. Another time I had a driver refuse to get on the highway (highway takes 15 minutes for me to get to work, back roads takes 30,35) despite me repeatedly telling him he was going to make me late for work. He didn't just answer me and just kept pointing to the map on his phone. I've taken this same trip literally a couple hundred times, and this was the only time a driver did not take the highway. Uber is a customer service based job, maybe stop hiring people who can't communicate effectively.",

The app moved to view the airport and asked me to select my location. I backed out and tried again, and the app still insisted that I select a location within the airport. Funny thing... There was a blue dot on my REAL PICK up location, but the app was not allowing me to click on the blue dot. When I manually entered my location, it still swung back to the airport!!! I had my 2 yr old with me and had no choice to agree to the ridiculous overcharging. When I brought this to Uber's attention, I was dismissed and they gave me a response of ""It was higher because of the demand for the Uber service""... Yeah... OK!!! Long story, I was ripped off and Uber gives no **. I am NOT using this service ever again.",

I noticed how unfair the prices, pay is so I decided to ask passangers to send me via text how much they actually paid (after they got the email with how much their actual fare was) and time and time again what I got paid based on fare was off by $1-4 on each trip!  They steal from the drivers!  Not only they take their 20% they take more!  When you report it on each trip they come back and say oh ok the fare will be adjusted, not only they adjust it wrong but you never see that money, ever.  When will that adjustment hit your account?  Never!  Be aware, you will pay more then 20% take, it's more like 35% most rides because if like the passanger pays $10 in reality they paid like 13-14$!",
1,Undisclosed charges and fees - This company does not offer support to its driver partners.

0,"Two days ago I took a trip with Uber in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. I normally use this service every day. Another passenger with me on the trip forgot their phone in the car. Since then we have sent about 20 messages to Uber Customer service. They finally determined that the driver found the phone but we are still waiting for it to be returned. Uber and the driver now have my direct contact information and yet the only way I can get any feedback is through the Uber Customer Service system. I think that in such cases Uber should make it easier for the driver and customer to communicate directly. I will no longer be using Uber or recommending their services after this incident. We just want our item returned and I no longer trust this service, its reliability or safety rating.",

The return was a nightmare, I was watching the driver going around in circles. I tried calling him but he did not answer. He finally called me, I could barely understand him. He wanted me to meet him almost a block away. I told him I have and disability and needed him to pick me up in front of Clyde's, he then just cancelled my ride.",

The car was very old and although it seemed cleaned out, it smelled horrible.  The thick stench of cigarettes literally made me sick.  We tried to converse with him and he hardly said two words. He really gave me a ""creepy"" feeling... like we were in a car with someone with ""serious mental issues"" (only nice way to put it) .   I think I'd feel safer in a regular Taxi any day.   I have to say though that I had a really good experience with two drivers I used in Destin, FL.  But the two I got in Nashville made me not want to chance Uber ever again.",
0,"Regardless of what Uber says... they could care less about driver earnings, they are just interested in signing up new drivers. Last Saturday night, in Ocean City Maryland... a coastal town which runs about 7 miles long had 11 drivers. That is one for every 2000 feet of roadway. That is nothing but total BS. About every three days I get a message from Uber offering a $350 bonus if I refer a new driver and they make 50 trips. Hey Uber... how about concentrating on the drivers you have and making your driver app work?",
1,"Uber doesn't care for its drivers. So UBER doesn't take any fuel charges for over 2 weeks, then sends a letter explaining how it was their fault and they will correct the problem over two pay periods only take all the fuel charges from me in one pay. And on top of that, riders damage my vehicle and UBER tells me pay $1,000 deductible to file a claim. They overcharge riders on the upfront pricing and takes over 25% of nearly all rides over 2 miles. And it's not fair that driving at night subjects me to being rated by drunk racists who in turn are the deciding factors to whether I am able to continue driving on the platform.",

I have been back and forth via e-mail with Uber and have tried everything that they have told me to, but nothing is working. I have since had to pay out $47 in transportation costs because I cannot use my Uber credit. It shows up on my account but won't process. Uber has not been able to give me any solution nor have they attempted to refund my money. I don't have money to just give away, I want my $30 back.

0,"Uber driver was late and stopped 50 meters ahead of where he was supposed to be. We wave him down but he doesn't come. We call him, he doesn't talk but hangs up then a couple of seconds later starts moving towards us at 5km/h
 I question if he is ok when he arrives as he seems either drunk or sleepy or just completely spaced out. I don't want to risk the lives of myself and my partner and her  
 5 year old son. Driver gets aggressive and doesn't want to drive us anymore after we waited for him for so long. I tell him not to yell as he is scaring the 5 year old and its at this moment that he cancels the trip and orders us to get out of his car.
 The 5 year old boy is getting out of the car with one leg on the ground when the driver decides to accelerate. This fool is playing a game with his 1500kg car and a 20kg child. We yell at him and I put the car in park so that he cant harm anyone. We advised him we will be taking it up with the Police.
 Its at this moment, like an infant, this driver begins playing the victim and starts pacing around his car while its in the middle of the road with doors open and hazards on. A tantrum for the adult who realises what he has done is wrong and illegal.
 I have contacted uber and am awaiting their call. If I'm not happy I have an active social media presence and will escalate to the proper ombudsmen as well as the police.
 I REALLY hope uber do not defend this dangerous and irresponsible individual and resolve this quickly.
 Very very disappointed and angry,....
edit: Update - uber customer service (if you can call it that) is abysmal. They are siding with the driver and banning the passenegers account whilst not revealing ANYTHING about their 'investigation' hiding behind their privacy policy.  strongly considering posting the pics and videos of the driver and his car online.
Customer service rep was Abhi who didn't provide us with any resolution and in fact just made things much much worse. Please don't pretend to care about dangerous behaviour if you clearly don't...",
1,"Used Uber probably about 10 times. 98% of the time they arrived almost 30 minutes late and ended up at the wrong destination. They didn't pay attention to the sign on the road showing the address nor did they have a reliable means of locating such a simple address. Absolutely ridiculous! In the last few times I used them they also added a booking fee of $2.50. Unimpressed! In speaking with the drivers, they're not from the area and don't know where they are going. Relying solely on a GPS. One driver didn't even know his bearings, N, S, E, W. That baffled me to no end. As a result of this crappy service, I've cancelled my account with them. Local cabs are only a few dollars more, arrive on time and know EXACTLY where they are going!!!",
0,This damn service has been charging me for rides that I haven't used!!! I just notice that on my bank statement that Uber been charging me 3 to 4 rides a week.

My next step is to report Uber to the BBB and take them to court on this crap. For now on I'll take a cab and pay the extra money instead of getting ripped off by UBER!!! PEOPLE Stop using uber!!!,

I tried for days to get in touch with Uber about the form they have that you need but you CANNOT get in touch with anyone in any way. They just reply from generalized questions on their website.",

1,"We have never used Uber and did not know the procedure, so a friend of ours called to confirm our 10 minute trip from her home to the airport. The ride would cost us $60. We didn't know our friend charged it on her account. Of course when we got to the airport the driver removed our luggage and held out his hand. We gave him $60 unknowingly that they are paid in advanced over the phone with a secured credit card payment. He knew darn well it must of been a mistake. No way anyone tips $60 for a 10 minute ride. He did not say anything. The driver kept the money.",
0,I've been driving for Uber for a while now and the Uber navigation application is a total disappointment. When you accept a rider request the address for the rider disappears from the application screen leaving you at the mercy of the Uber application which doesn't navigate very well. So you don't have time to enter it in your vehicle GPS application. Then the Uber application routes you to the wrong location and doesn't understand what direction your car is actually going I used both Google maps and Waze applications and had the same issue. The Uber application doesn't interface with either well and has you going in circles quite often. Uber will waste your time and money when you make some. Uber gets a big portion of it in fees. They should have done a better job of development. My car GPS runs circles around Uber's application and has no problems getting me to specific addresses. So what's wrong with Uber's application?,

After waiting for long and not able to see the driver, I called him up and asked how much more time it will take and where was he? He said it will take only 2 mins to reach. He was not telling the proper destination and on further inquiring, got to know that it was not 2 mins but 10-15 mins. I also got to know that the driver was moving to opposite direction.

Secondly they give you ""incentives"" but then make it impossible to reach those. I should have earned an additional $40 and instead they say that somehow I didn't meet the requirements. This company is a joke!",
0,"I confirmed a pick up for 8:55 am for an Uber. The trip for the driver to come and pick me up says he'll be at my place in 5 minutes. So 30 minutes passed and the driver never shows up so I have to cancel the pick up from Uber but before I cancel, Uber deducted to my account of $5.61 and when I cancel the pick up they credited me with $5 for the next ride. Why would I used Uber again if they screwed me up? I think it's not my fault if they did not fulfill the contract that they will be at my place in 5-9 minutes. That's why I have to cancel the trip otherwise I will stick to it.",
1,"Well when I sign up with Uber I was looking for some extra income on the side. In the beginning it started pretty slow, but I figured some things out to make decent money using Uber. Like some of the previous reviews the money you make doesn't really cover all of your expenses like gas, car maintenance, etc. For example your total trip fee is 407.80 - Uber fee 103.21 = my actual earnings 304.59 - gas $70 = 234.59 for about 27 online hours. Which comes out to be about 8.69/hr below minimum wage. I put up with it because I needed the money. ",
1,"I picked the customer from the exactly surge area and they went to 12 miles away. So, I was in the surge area which is x3.0. But Uber gave me no surge for this trip. I messaged to Uber, they said, I was not in the surge. But I was sure. Next day, I got another request from surge place. That time, I took the screenshot which shows the request comes from surge sides but no surge appears. I send these information to Uber. Uber still says no and this was not in the surge side and asking me customer's name. I don't save customers name or any information of customers. I said like I know which trip was it and I sent the trip information I have to them. They still says what was the customer's name, trip date or whatever. They don't give my money.",
1,Trabajar como chofer  de uber Es el tipo de exploration mas horrible que se a credo en la ultima decada ya que no cumplen con sus predicaciones donde recomendan que se unan a ellos como trabajadores,
0,"I took an Uber in the terminal to my house. The bill was 27.00. Later on I checked my credit card and I was charged with 150.00 cleaning fee!! It was me and my wife in the back seat. The driver put the luggage in the trunk. I emailed Uber immediately, and they send me a picture of a back seat full of garbage, rocks, food, etc. I explained the situation, I called my bank. Finally they apologized to me and they promised me a complete refund. Please, from now on, take a picture of the car before and after. This drivers use any kind of strategy to charge you 10 times more money. Be advised. Thanks.",
1,"Uber for me is so buggy that I can simply not use it. I can not get my head around how a billion dollar company can not build a working app or website. 
Bug (design flaw) 1: you need to request permission through support to use the mobile website as a rider.
Bug 2: right now, the entire help.uber.com website is down. For hours. What?!
Bug 3: once you've been granted ""permission"" to use the mobile web-interface for rides, there is no way to change your phone number. There's an ""edit"" button for the phone number on the non-mobile website, but this then tells you to go to the app (which you can't use, that's why you're using the mobile site, durrrr).
Bug 4 (design flaw): once you've signed up with Uber there is no easy online way to delete your Uber account. I've looked into this and you actually need to contact support (the same support who's webpage is completely down right now) and write them an email saying you want your account deleted. Really?! In 2017? They're a billion dollar company but their website and software is worse than that written by a startup full of 12 year olds in their moms basement. I feel sorry for any talented coders working under Uber's obviously out of control ""manage""ment.",
0,"I have a issue with one of my ride which I was wrongly charged. But Uber is not giving me such option where I can write about this or even ask about it. On 17th of jan., 2017 i booked a uber from besent nagar, Chennai to Hotel leela Palace, mrc nagar. First rate estate was showing approx INR 60 but receipt came of INR 130. 
Then i checked and found that driver started the meter from where he got that i request a cab and drop location was also wrong, he stopped the meter somewhere else after droped me at my location. 
My email id is *****@gmail.com",
1,I signed up almost a month ago. I get the same e-mail daily. Processing your account. The site said 5 to 7 days. Not a month. I signed up before Christmas now I'm almost 3/4 through January. Why? Nobody can tell me. I have gotten a hold of customers services many times. Still waiting.,
1,"I am Active Duty Army. I tried to apply to be a driver for Uber. They will not accept my valid drivers license. My license has an expectation date of 00/00/0000 because under Tennessee law it does not expire until I exit the service. Uber's automated email system kept telling me that it was expired. When I emailed the help line, I got an email back saying this:
""we understand that you had a question about requesting an exception to our requirement for a valid State driver's license. I'm afraid that we are currently unable to allow exceptions to this requirement. We know that Active Duty Service Members may relocate frequently. While many local regulations recognize this, these terms do not necessarily apply beyond personal driving.""
There is nothing wrong with my license, I am not asking for an exemption. My license is valid. 
On top of that I had to jump through hoops to get my account reset because when I drunkenly set it up the first time I put in the wrong email.
So I am beyond fed up with this company. I'm moving to Lyft!",
1,"I see there are four cabs near my home still 2x surge !!! Switching to Ola.
If this continues uber will shut down soon.",
1,I am a single mother of a three month old baby trying to get back on my feet. Long story short I got a job working full-time. I am staying at Motel 6 and was taking Uber to drop off my baby and go to work every day. The first day it cost $4 to go 2 blocks to the babysitter and then $11 to get to work. I had to borrow money for the next two weeks for rides and then pay them back when I get paid. Well the next day it was $9 to get to the babysitter and then $20 to get to work. I had no idea that they price gouged according to demand and now I don't have enough money for rides... Thanks a lot UBER!,
0,My daughter left her new boots (Blundestones) in an Uber cab in Toronto. When she got home she realized they were missing from all the luggage. She texted the driver but he did not reply. We were on our way out of the country on a family vacation for two weeks so she had no contact until our return. She went into the head office in Toronto and they contacted the driver. He did admit to finding the boots and also admitted to giving them to a family member who lives in B.C. ,
0,"On January 6 I rode my first ride with Uber. I got my first uber ride and it said it was 4 minutes away. We went down to meet him and I followed him on the map. He finally came to the place where we got it and he kept circling the place for five minutes so I called Bewkete and asked him if he needed directions and he told me, ""No. I'll be there later."" So I waited and saw that he left then started going in the opposite direction we were going and went out 5 miles away. So I called him again and he didn't answer. So he texted me back saying, ""I'll talk to you later.""",
1,"I am now writing this review as NOT ONE PERSON AT UBER is assisting me. I have now for 9 weeks not being paid for my ETA's, I am absolutely disappointed. When us as Uber partners don't accept each and every request, it affects our profile, but yet, Uber does not come to the party? Why are ETA's not being paid? Why has Uber not been making efforts to look after their Partners the way the Partners look after Uber?",
0,"On Wednesday 11th January (@ 6:19PM) I booked Uber Cab and Uber app showed waiting time approx 10 mins, in between I then checked my mails for 2-3 mins, and when I opened Uber app again (after 4mins) it showed nothing (means it looked like no cab was booked, and in fact I didn't see booked cab details). I then opened Uber app and booked the cab again (@6:26 PM) and successfully trip completed.",
1,I have been driving with Uber for over three months. I have great reviews from passengers who I have dropped off at many locations all around Orlando. I strongly recommend that no one drives with Uber. They are complete rip off. You will spend more money on gas and put so many miles on your car that you don't even make enough to fill your tank back up and on top of that if there's a rude passenger which Uber does not confirm who the passenger is. They will cause damage to your car and once he reported to Uber they will tell you that he sent it off to an insurance adjuster and I did no longer responsible. Any insurance adjuster will tell you that you have to pay $1000 or more to fix your own car. They don't want to take responsibility for anything and when you sign up for Uber it clearly states that they are responsible for damages caused by passengers.,
1,I had my rating at 4.8 with 2500 plus rides and no complaints from Uber for 5 months. I uploaded this video which is on this page created by somebody else. Within few days I received an email from Uber and they wanted to talk over the phone... To my surprise because they never have live person that you can talk. Told the guy that they need to provide me with a lawyer and that they must pay for high tech cameras so I can protect myself while driving for Uber. They said that they will not do anything and following day they shut down my access and couple months later they discontinued my partnership for violating company policy. To this day I don't know what I did and they refused to provide AAPD with all the records... Stating that none can be found.,
1,Booked a ride with them and was not taken to correct location. Contacted for a refund. They gave a refund and 4 days later increased the amount of the fare and charged my account again. Now refusing to correct the situation. I will never use or recommend Uber again. I'd rather walk 10 miles!,
1,The service and availability is good but they put exorbitant fare almost every day. Practically useless for daily commuters.,
1,"This review is not just about the airport pick up, but in general for people who wish to know how to travel.
The best and only taxi company that I would recommend is Blue Bird, they are great! They always use the meter and the drivers are professional
The other taxi companies (dark blue, purple, grey colour taxis, not the light blue - blue bird taxis) are all rip offs!  Be careful, they are scammers and rude 99% of the time.
Ok now onto Uber, it can be great and it can be not so great, I would say 75% of the time it is good, but if you get one of these drivers look out -
Booked a Uber ride at 6.09pm with driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya"" to pick up from Nikki Beach Club, after waiting at the front of the club for 10 mins it was clear he was not coming as his vehicle which was 1km away was not moving in our direction, but I was surprised when the app changed to being on the journey, a few minutes later it finished but I was charge 15,000 rah (of course you waste time and write to uber the they refund it, but why should loyal passengers need to go through such crap when it is clearly not their fault?)
I then booked Uber again at 6.19pm, the same driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya"" accepted the booking but this time, he messages me on WhatsApp to tell me unless i pay cash he is not coming, so I try to change the payment method to cash but this is not allowed on the Uber app, so when I tell the driver this he says unless I pay him cash he will not come!!  He then asked me to cancel, but luckily it is within the 5 min BS time limit so I am not charged a cancellation fee this time (even though again it is not my fault!)
I advised the driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya"" that the service is terrible, he told me he does not care and when I said I would report this service to Uber he said ""I do not fear"", clearly Uber does not care for passenger service and is happy to hire anyone in Bali as a driver, as I would never employee someone with such an attitude, especially when now 18 hours later he just sent me another offence message to my phone ""You Emang Top""
Anyway avoid the driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya""with phone number +62 821 4407 1347
I then attempted to make another booking, this time it was picked up by driver ""Nyoman"", this booking was at now 6.29pm, this driver was 8 minutes away and started driving to my location, so I was thinking great finally have a driver, he was within about 3 minutes away and then I noticed he kept going passed the turn off and when I contacted him he said he is not coming, I could see on the app he was like 3 mins away, then 6 mins, 9 min, 12 min and clearly not coming to Nusa Dua but driving to Ulawatu, this driver just ignored all contact from me via message/phone, just keep driving and I guess waiting for me to cancel, which I finally did, clearly another driver that does not care for passenger service
Please avoid ""Nyoman"" driver and his number is +62 812 3786 5029, he clearly does not care and should not be allowed to drive for Uber.
Ok so finally made another booking with Uber, it is now 6.40pm, the guy turns up, very nice driver, but as I got into the car and sat down my daughter was just getting into the car and the driver starts to drive off, without her being in the car, the door was still open, my daughter then hit the road and was left on the street, this was clearly an accident but careless driving from Uber, I will not write his name, as he was nice, but clearly not careful.
Anyway basically after about 4 bookings, waiting 40 minutes, writing to uber for refund for my 15,000 Rph, we made it home to the villa in seminyak.
Honestly i love Uber, use it all over the world, however, I think in some cities like China (especially Beijing), Bali and Sydney the server now is terrible and the prices are on the increase so a taxi can be about the same!!!!  Once uber gets the marketshare they want they increase the prices without warning!",
1,Why is it if they take money out of your account for the Uber rides that they have to take additional money which they say it's an authorization hold but they do not put it back for at least eight days and this is money that I cannot access and another thing if you have an Uber gift card they still want to put monies from the ride from your checking account on hold  when it is confirmed that they will get paid by the Uber gift card. I have for three weeks been trying to resolve this problem on two separate situations and the customer service is horrible. Isn't it illegal for them to keep a hold on your  money even after they get paid for the services of an Uber driver taking you to your destination. And why does it take so long for it to drop off from your checking account they should confirm you have the money then debit your account for the Uber ride and then that's it. I am trying to find out  how to issue an official complaint against Uber because of the situation can you please help,
1,"I started driving with Uber late October 2016. My first week I worked 80 hours, grossed $220., paid $25. Of that in fuel. Put a lot of wear and tear on my brand new Toyota Corolla. Those of you riders that complain about service, remember, you get what you pay for. For me, I realized what a terrible company Uber is for drivers. I wouldn't drive for them again ever.",
0,"Uber drivers are cheater. I must say that my sister left her phone while boarding to a cab. At first side cab driver is ready to give her phone after his shift over, but on the second day, he denies to do it. I need a resolution asap. Otherwise, I will go to police against the company. As a proof, I have everything in call recording.",
1,"We used Uber to travel 8.2 miles from our hotel to downtown Nashville on New Years Eve. The fare was approximately $15 which was reasonable. When we were ready to leave on New Years Day the Uber app showed because of the high demand our fare increased to 9.7 times. It was raining and there we did not see other choices (taxi's, buses, Lyft) available so I agreed to this. Our bill to go back to our hotel was over $140.00. I received an invoice from our first fare of $15.00 but I never received an invoice from the $140.00 fare. I emailed Uber about the invoice and did not receive a response. Nothing that I read in the Uber app discussed this and I feel this is completely underhanded of Uber to pull this kind of a stunt.",
1,Firstly Uber uses an outsourced call center to receive and take calls for their company. The employee I spoke to was a supervisor by the name of JOHN who was in the Philippines. He did not care about my concerns about my safety. They are unconsidered with their employee's SAFETY. The driver is unaware of who they are picking up or even where they are going until the rider gets in the car. I have had questionable riders get into my vehicle and ask to be taken to areas that's did not feel or look safe. Ubers only consider is making sure you get the rider to their destination and not how to protect its drivers from harm while driving. This company should really evaluate the safety for not only their riders but their Drivers as well.,
1,Uber Support for Drivers is a disaster. They tell you to do the same thing over and over and keep giving you negative results. They also change their story constantly. No wonder they are unprofitable. I pity the fool who invests in this company. Incompetence is an art form at the support center. A bunch of malfunctioning robots.,
0,"After a long trip we took Uber from our airport to home. It was my fault that in gathering our things I left one small bag in the back seat. I have been trying to contact the driver/Uber since then. My first attempt to contact the driver was successful in reaching him BUT he promised to bring the bag over but hasn't shown up yet (48 hours). I have tried contacting him again through the Uber App, which is the only way I know to get in touch with him. No return calls yet. I then went back to the app and followed the ""can't contact the driver"" link and have reached out to Uber to become involved -- twice. No response from Uber. This is NOT what I think of when I think of customer service. The bag contains critical things like me heart/BP Medication and my passport!",
1,"I ordered an Uber. Price estimate was between 27-35$. I ordered Uber, and they charged me 73.00$. More than double the price estimate. There was no traffic. I took that route multiple times, at different times of the day and the maximum charge for the trip was 38-40$. Now 73.00$. I wrote to them numerous times, but they gave me silly explanation and never refunded my money. Definitely they should not charge me more than 35$. They have your credit cards, and they think they can charge whatever they feel like it. Someone has to look at what Uber is doing.",
1,Uber is allowing credit theft from companies like PayPal! Was hacked for 300 dollars in Uber charges that I didn't make! Shut them down for not able to verify payment from fraud! Do not use your app for paying through Uber!,
1,"I signed up for a ride and UBER sent the driver to the destination not the pick up point. So the driver came all the way back to get me as he said it was UBER'S fault and that this happens every once in a while. Then they charged me for all the time the driver spent both ways, I sent in a complaint and they told me basically, ""Too bad sorry we can not credit you."" They charged me nearly 3 times what the original quote was. Thanks for reading this.",
0,I have been driving for Uber for 10 months and today I found out they are not reimbursing the drivers in Hampton Roads Virginia the correct amount for the tolls. I spoke to a few reps who informed me they will only correct the past 10 days. SHAME on Uber for not taking care of their drivers and doing the right thing.,
1,"My Uber account was hacked and someone swiped $475 from my bank account. They used the Uber cash for UberEats and some rides. I contacted Uber and they agreed that since my bank card had been canceled that they would give me Uber cash credit, which I agreed to because I knew I would eventually use it. They only refunded me $225 and ignored my repeated attempts to explain that that wasn't the complete refund. After days of trying to resolve the issue, they closed my account entirely. Their ""cut"" and ""paste"" responses make no sense and now they're ignoring me entirely.",
1,"I had both Lyft and Uber apps and when I needed to go somewhere, I would compare the prices on both. In doing this comparison one day, I saw that Uber was a lot cheaper that day (which almost never happens) by about $2 something. I jumped at it and booked my ride with Uber and was taken to my destination. I paid and thought that was it. THE NEXT DAY (I swear), Uber charged me an ADDITIONAL $2 something (just about identical to what the difference in prices between Uber and Lyft were for that distance).",
1,This past week I used the Uber service twice to attend a meeting at my job. Both rides from my house to the office and vice versa were two different prices than what I was initially shown before submitting the ride request. When I contacted Uber via email they stated that the prices I showed them from my bank statements weren't showing on their system. The only price they can see is the initial upfront price before I submitted the request for the ride. This is a fraudulent company and I don't recommend anybody using their services. Uber is a bunch of thieves and I believe no one is actually at the receiving end of the emails but yet just a bunch of automatic messages. Never will I be using Uber again. This company needs to be shut down.,
0,"Most of the drivers are unprofessional. Even in summers the A/C won't be switched on and when asked, they re-confirm if we really want A/C! The most frustrating cases are where they accept the ride, don't turn up to the location, don't call, don't pick up our calls and then choose to cancel it putting the cancellation charges on us. Other transportation options are in fact becoming better where Uber is just getting worse day by day.",
1,"In my most recent requests for an Uber Ride here in April 2018, I was quoted a price on the app, and the final charge to my card was nearly twice the amount. I was completely shocked, felt deceived, and was completely blindsided. Their advertisement stating that you will know your price before requesting your ride is not true and misleading. Additionally, I was charged a â€œwait feeâ€ on these requests. How can I be charged a wait fee when I was standing at the curb when the driver pulled up? I will no longer use Uber for a ride, and will give my business to Lyft.",
1,Great idea of sharing your rides. But it is turning to taxi service which is not good. Usually good service. Convenient application. Inexpensive. Unfortunately price is going up. Can't wait when self driving cars witbe available. Robotaxi!!!,
1,"04-12-2018  Warning! do not do any type of buisness with uber!! they have become pure evil!   they no longer have customer service support. You can not reach anyone by phone and they email support team is paid by how may tickets they answer not how many problems they solve. so you get uncaring people playing games and giving you fake responses that do not help you over and over again. I have pleaded with these people and told them they placed the wrong account to my phone number and email so therefore I can not log on to see my pay tax forms or drive,  they keep sending a short response telling me to check my app?? sooo I am done they messed up my account and have been giving my false help for over a week......so please beware beause if something should happen and you need them....you get people in another country playing games with your life!!  BEWARE UBER IS EVIL",
1,The most advertised company Uber Eats has worst application and the order procedure where they don't let the customer to cancel the order but reflects on guidelines to ask on support where the customer support also keeps on wasting time of the customer during the procedure so that they can charge the price of order and then cancel it. Happened twice. Customer executive name: Saurabh.,
1,"I purchased $50.00 (paid 48.00 per their promotion) of Uber credits, i.e., Uber Cash on 2/15/19. I could not use this Uber Cash until March. My recent rides since then total $34.00, meaning I should have a balance of $16.00. But my account has a balance of only $6.00; $10.00 has gone to places unknown. There is no phone number to call on this, and the website is useless. I strongly DO NOT recommend using Uber Cash. Your money goes into a black hole.",
1,The cancellation fee should change because if a driver is 20-30 minutes away I would like to cancel because I need someone closer and you can't see how far away the driver is until you confirm the price and that's when you see how far away the driver is to meet with and you. And in most times the cancellation fee is taken out even if you don't meet with the driver and you cancel the fee is taking out the app show $0.00. And when you check your debit card account it show that it has been taken out so sometime needs to be done or changes to the app and service!!,
1,"I ordered $50 dollars worth of food, the delivery was 5 minutes away, but the driver drove past my house to deliver someone else's food so it took 20 minutes after pickup for delivery. The food was not edible so I tried to cancel the order. I tried to return the food, but neither the burger place or Uber would refund or return the untouched slop they delivered to me. They have horrible customer service and mislead their customers by not advertising ""all sales are final,"" they should be closed down for fraudulent practices.",
1,I just got charged an extra $20 for a trip that allegedly took 20 min than it actually did. I was dropped off 20 min earlier than shown in the receipt. Uber's receipt is based on false information that Uber has profited from. Disgraceful!,
1,"Have a problem with Uber gift card and it's been 2 months as of April 2018. After being bounced around from different Uber helpers via email since you can't call into uber, the problem is still not fixed with my gift card. Every response is an automate response because they never read the full compliant. Finally got move to a manager and the response was also automated. Was told they can't do anything if you gift card got stolen, when I never mention it being stolen. I have to card but then it's not working, so uber robbed me of $200.00 now!",
0,"The drivers, of course drive extremely fast. To get to no-where, then they will scam you by adding extra charges to your ride. Some will even put you out. The also have some drivers with filthy and nasty vehicles. They will hire anybody.",
1,"I ordered UberPool, with 30% discount, the ride price was $5. Uber asked me if I want to walk and pay cheaper. I didn't want to walk and price got $9. I canceled and tried again, and again, from $5 (with discount) price got $9. I was trying to contact Uber - no way. I took taxi. Now I'm trying to reach Uber to get to know what to expect and why price got up - Uber has no customer service and no way to contact Uber.",
0,"We're driving on White School Rd Sevierville 2:30, 4/8/19. Driver whipped around us splashing puddles of water everywhere. He was speeding. It was raining, and it was downright scary. A School bus was en route and this road has many curves. The UBER driver was unsafe and a danger to us, school children and everyone else on the road. I found it disturbing that nobody from UBER can be reached by phone, text or email. I think there is enough detail in my review. People need to be able to CONTACT CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS. I tried and got redirected to everything but the tooth fairy... TRY CALLING UBER TO REPORT A COMPLAINT FOLKS... Let me know what website you're redirected to.",

Despite sending an email with a picture of FreedomPop's app showing otherwise and a link showing that my phone does not have a phone number in settings as the way FreedomPop works is weird they keep responding with the same message ""It looks like a VOIP"" and ""send a screenshot of the settings"" which my phone does not have.",

I got the paperwork from my bank and submitted it to Uber. Uber claims that there was a technical issue and the payment was pending. According to Uber, the payment was deposited into my account successfully. The only problem is that my bank says otherwise.",
1,I have been a loyal customers for a few years. I take several Ubers a day spending roughly almost $ a month. I have two jobs and mistakenly put the address of the wrong job. 2 minutes into the ride I realized I was going to the wrong location. Instead of going right he went left. I told him to let me out (okay with being charged being that it was my mistake) but when I told him to stop he rode faster to the destination making it completely unsafe and dangerous being that it was also raining this morning. He left me at my destination leaving me all the way on the other side making the fare that much higher. I had to pay an additional $15 to the $7.63 I had to pay for the last one.,
1,"I downloaded the app in Charleston and didn't even get to use it before it locked me out and wouldn't let me use either mobile number to create another account. Absolutely rubbish, terrible customer service. I couldn't even delete my account as it wouldn't let me. They kept referring me to emails the support team had sent but I never received them. Totally disgraceful company.",
0,Your diver was not professional. He came very late for pick up. He took 15 minutes for 3 kilometers and he is not ready to understand my problem. I face very bad experience. Early morning empty roads of Chandigarh he took 15 minutes. OMG. 6:30am I did my booking. 6:45 he came to pick me up. It is hardly 2 minutes distance. From driver location to my pick point location. It was madness that I trust on your company and your professional drivers.,
1,I used Uber in 3 countries recently and service was totally good. They should work a bit their customer relationship,
1,"Arrived at port Columbus Ohio few days ago and did not have a ride. For the first time, I downloaded Uber app. to get a short ride home. Prior to my arrival, I was in Chicago and checked their fair prices and it seemed inexpensive.  Once I arrived in Columbus, I requested a ride which was higher by $9.25 So I thought maybe it was after hours and that would be ok. The driver arrived early and would not wait for me to get out of the airport so he took off because I was not outside immediately. I was not happy so I got on the Uber app again and requested a new ride. This time the fair was twice the original amount. I was totally upset. But who can I call. The drive informed me that they only pay him $1 per mile regardless of how much Uber charges the customers. I felt sorry for him and told him that I personally would not use Uber again.",
1,I scheduled an Uber pick up for 3 am in north Scottsdale Az for a 5:15 am plane. Uber did nothing to assure there would be a driver available at that hour. Uber simply began searching for a driver at 3 am. As a result I was forced to wake my son to take me to the airport. This is not a scheduled car service. It is unreliable. I will make other arrangements in the future. Thedaler,
1,"First off, the drivers are amazing. For one company to have so many positive and professional employees is amazing. However, I am certain that their awesomeness is not a result of the trickle down effect. I know this because, when it comes to Uber's corporate staff, customer service does not exist; literally! Their one flaw that I've observed in every driver is directly the daily of Uber executives. That flaw is poor GPS technology. Nearly every GPS app (including Waze and Lyft) is superior to Uber. This is a problem that would have been solved if the company had a customer service strategy and department worth mentioning.",
0,My wife and I took a train to NYC and when we got to the street a driver asked if we needed a Taxi which we said yes. When we got to his car we saw it was a SUV. I asked if he was an UBER driver and he said yes. I asked him to take us to the cruise ship terminal which was approx. 2 miles away. When we arrived he said that it would be $60.00 Yes $60.00. We were very disappointed because he did not give us a price to our destination. When the cruise was over we ended up taking a TAXI back to Penn center which we were charged $10.00. This was a bad experience for us and NYC should have better control of UBER drivers. I thought they were supposed to be in line with the Taxis. UBER just got their first and last trip from us.,
1,"They did it twice. They overcharge. Last month some driver charged me 390 when it was showing 298. He said in mine it showing this,  when asked to show he said you check it again. But since my sister had booked it and I did not have the phone agreed and paid. I did not all her for somepersonal reason. But last night I was a fool I did not call my sister to confirm. The driver named swapnil picked me up from matunga at 9.45 and dropped me at powai. His car was from panvel. He was going to go without a passenger once I get down. The bill shown was 317 and he charged me 450. I gave him since I was in a hurry, instead I should have called my sister and confirmed. But is this ethically right? If I want to spend much money no matter how small or big the amount is I will do it all my will. I do not want such thugs around. Everytime overcharging.

0,"They use to be decent but I've found that the drivers are ignorant and racist in certain areas. Uber has no control of the drivers so the quality sucks. I had a driver nodding at the light (obviously high)...I got out of his car, he complained to Uber on me and they suspended my account...lol. They didn't investigate that the driver was a junkie. USE LYFT OR JUNO IF YOU'RE IN NEW YORK! They're cheaper, pay their drivers better and give much better service.",
1,"My Uber arrived on time, car was clean though it reeked of cologne and had an overwhelming smell of either a car or a dog. I get in the car and get about a mile up the road and the Uber driver is heading in the direction of the neighboring county, though I'm in the next county in the complete opposite direction. I told him to turn around and go down a road heading in the correct direction to my home, but he blurted out, annoyed stating ""that road is shut down, and I can drop you off here and you can wait on the next Uber"". I stated that I was not getting out, and â€œI don't care which way you takeâ€, it just better be $24.14 like Uber stated on their website, which I screenshotted. ",
0,"Take Uber services at your own risk! Drivers may hoodwink you into paying more or cash for a non-cash trip! Uber help will wash their hands off and refuse to even contact the driver to sort out the issue! U Bet and End up Risky! I took a trip which had a Rs.75/- coupon applied. At the end of the trip Uber displayed Rs.279.82/- The driver asked me to pay what is displayed on the screen because he is unable to see it on his screen. I paid him 280/- and left the car. When I checked the Uber receipt, I found the trip cost to be only Rs.204.82/- I contacted the driver who offered to return the money; but later retracted. Uber also said they are unable to help. Uber displays two rates for a single trip; one higher and the other lower but displayed only in the receipt section. You will first notice the higher amount and pay!!! A system designed to allow drivers to take more money.",
1,"I set up an Uber account. Great! (or so I thought) I used the service frequently, always maintained a score of 5.0 clearly displayed on my account beside my picture in my profile. I had to factory reset my phone, could not get my account back. Tried to re-register and was told my phone number was already in use. Received an email after finding some random way to complain through their app and was told the agent had to enter my account and set my phone number. Fine, no problem. Started off with a new account and went to add my picture and could not. I emailed back the same agent at which point he referred to me as a driver. I used Uber 4 times and just had a random email sent to me from Uber showing my score suddenly at a 4.87. How, I have no idea. I tipped, was friendly, showed up on time, gave 5 stars. My account still does not let me add my picture and does not show my score. ",
0,My friend spent her 21st birthday clubbing and by the end of the night she was puking. Our Uber driver came to pick us up knowing we had a night of partying and a sick friend. On our drive home he stopped to let her puke. However she did puke on the outside and made a small mess in the car. After our trip I cleaned up everything inside it car as quick as I could. Then a week later we were charged with $150 for cleaning along with the charge of the trip for a very very minimal amount of puke on the seat belt and the outside of the car. We gladly would have paid 50 dollars for clean up however no matter what way we spun it definitely didnt cost 150 dollars to clean a car. He knew when he responded to our Uber need that we would be drunk. If he didnt want drunk people he did not need to respond. We will be sticking with lyft from now on.,
1,Uber needs to be shut down. They treat the drivers unfairly also the riders. I'm always being short paid instead they increase the service fee. How is it that they get paid more than me on a trip. That doesn't make sense. Drivers need to come together and report them or even boycott for a while until they fix the issues we are having and stop cheating us. If nothing changes then they Uber need to be ban from Atlanta.,
1,Don't use UBER!!! They are spamming me and stealing personal information they do not have permission to and worse... wont do anything about it. I can't imagine what info they are taking from those who have their app or actually signed up with them!,
1,"So generally, I prefer Lyft over Uber mainly because over time it became apparent to me that Lyft has a better attitude towards its customers than Uber. And my suspicion was confirmed a few months ago when the story broke about sexual harassment claims at Uber and how they were handled. Until now though, I had never really experienced first-hand the callous nature of Uber's leadership. Here is my story:",
0,"Got an Uber me and my friends on 6/9/18 at 3:03 am -3:30am. I was seated on the front passenger seat while playing music from my phone via the car's aux cable. When we got dropped I got out to help my friend who was seated at the back seat to get into the building. Before entering the building I realized that had left my phone in the Uber. After getting inside the building I attempt to call the Uber driver but he ignored all my calls. The phone rung but he never picked up. I called the driver multiple times and left him several voice mails to call me back. But he never called back. I went ahead and contacted Uber customer service and they informed me they've notified the driver about my phone. However, the driver stated he did not see any phone. But after tracking my phone it showed the device was in the Uber and got turned off 10 mins after he had dropped us... Such drivers are giving Uber a bad reputation.",
1,Uber is a big fraud . I live in Qatar and visited US where I booked uber  on 31st May . I got update on 13 June that I have been charged 150 dollars for cleaning. I was with my colleague and it was only 4 minutes trip and no mess has happened They are big fraud . Big time fraud,
1,"I was delivering for a client when she had forgotten to put her hotel room number down, I gladly advised her that she would have to come downstairs to pick up her food, at which case she did, however the very next day, I was told my account would be placed on hold for 24hrs because she suspected my car to smell like weed. I advised Uber I would take a drug test and do anything needed to suffice the allegation, however Uber decided upon themselves to shut down my driving status for not 24 but 48hrs instead... Uber lies, and so does the customer's supposed allegation that can't be proven... There should be protocol for things of that nature, however there aren't. This matter could have been dealt a little better, and cleared up and resolved, however I did not get that kind of approach from their hubs, nor their support system. Uber has a bad track record for unresolved issues, in my opinion, and that's the way they like it...",

0,"Not only was my driver unable to find me, we had to wait on the avenue rather than in front of the building where we were staying. On our trip home the driver went a roundabout way and that extended the trip by 8 miles plus the extra charge for the time. The original fare quote was changed. I understand charging for tolls but I don't want to contribute to some drivers fund that's tacked on at the bottom of the receipt. We are going back to car service where the fees are set. No surprises. No more $121. one way trips to NYC.",

I have been trying to get my $45 returned to me and they won't respond to my emails. NOTE: this was my 2nd time trying to use Uber and it completely failed. Not only did I not receive their services.

1,I took Uber in France Nice yesterday twice and they charged my credit card six times. I am in shock. As I am on holidays I can't cancel my card. Needless to say I won't be using them again. I don't know what they are trying to get away with but suffice to say I shall get the charges reversed and never use them again. What is the world coming to whereby this is a common business practice? Do yourself a favor... don't use Uber. Lots of other choices.,

1,"I FEEL DEFRAUDED BY UBER! Today, I did Uber express for $2.78. The map to walk to the pickup point was COVERED IN UBER NOTICES plus what little of the map I could see lacked any street names next to me, nor did uber provide directions on where to walk, nor were the dots accurate (perhaps it wanted me to use the backdoor because those dots sure didn't make sense walking out the front door) and Uber did NOT provide an exact physical address for me to google. Worst, is uber provides NO WAY TO CONTACT THEM and now uber charges me a $5 cancellation fee for a $2.78 ride? Seriously - this IS fraudulent! I'm reporting this to the DC & Florida attorney general's and I will NOT use uber again until this is resolved in person by a real live uber person. Get a clue uber - This does not work but I will to make sure you do not do this to others or me again!",
1,"Check your bill, if you take different trips write it down and what they charge you. We used it to go to work and home. Price should have been the same every day. Monthly bill came and there were several off prices about 6 we found. You call, give them info and 3-4 days later they call and say, ""ok, we can deduct it or give you a credit for further rides."" Myself, I would have liked to know how they got so screwed up but they offered no explanation for that. A few drivers don't speak English but our drive was easy. Good company. Just ALWAYS CHECKS your bills end of month.",

1,"Yesterday Uber had charged me $43.70 for 20 minutes 8.1 miles long drive that we were making two times a week for the past 2 years and usually costed us $18-21. I have contacted Uber and they claim that the charge is justified because it happened during alleged peak hours and after back and forth correspondence offered to credit me back 25% of that charge, which is still way too high. Let us run the numbers. Effectively, what Uber is trying to say by defending this charge of $43.70 for 20 minute 8.1 miles long ride is that your driver is making $131.10/hour that would translate into $272,480 annual salary!!! Really? An executive salary for the taxi drivers and you are expecting the general public to believe this nonsense!?! Which percent of this revenue the driver is actually going to see?",
1,"I usually purchase a Uber Gift Card to run weekly errands as Uber. The reason why I use that method was because every time I used my bank card Uber puts a ridiculous hold on my card causing my bank account to be overdrawn. To combat that issue I started purchasing the Uber Gift Card. This past weekend, I was preparing to go grocery shopping and tried requesting for an Uber using my gift card credit. This was a short trip literally 4 blocks at that. I received a message saying try a new payment method, so I said I will add another Uber gift card. That didn't work, so I called a local cab to pick up me up and take me to the store. I thought it may have been an issue with the application, so I went on shopping. I had already placed money on the gift card and wanted to use it to get back home. Another message advising me I must add a new payment method. ",

1,"My wife decided to start driving for Uber and Lyft this summer as a means of earning a small amount of additional income. Sadly she's been made to realize this was a major mistake. At least on the Uber side of things. We live in Tucson, Arizona, and on the Uber site it states that our city has no fee associated with vehicle inspection. However, after signing up and getting all her ducks in a row she came to find that her account had a negative -$20 balance. She has since called five times and been told each time that she will be credited within 24 to 72 hours. She's even gotten emails indicating this will occur. Yet here we are two weeks later and nothing has happened. ",

When I got my emailed receipt, the ride was $10 more than it should have been! I contacted Uber through email to resolve and they claimed that I chose the ""Uber XL"" trip, which was more $$ (I have to assume because my driver came in a newer Cadillac Escalade?), but I ABSOLUTELY did NOT choose that ride option when I booked it.

I thought the price was a little high going there, $30.00, but to my amazement, that was just their advertised price, to get back from the same spot, the price jumped to $65.00, more than double for the same distance. That's why we started using Uber several years ago to get away from the price gouging cab drivers, but now looks like Uber is the ones we need to be leery of. I will not be using Uber again.

At the very last minute we received a message saying there were no SUV's available.  We tried for almost an hour to reach someone to get a vehicle.  This ruined my daughters Prom, we had to ask a neighbor if they would mind taking them to the Prom.  I find this to be so unprofessional.  They ended up getting to the Prom about 1 1/2 hour late, missed meeting up with some of their friends to take group pictures. Never once have we received an apology for ruining my daughters special night. I would think twice about scheduling an Uber for any occasion.",

I made two transactions on InstaPay the weekend of May 19/20. Although I never received my instapay transactions and was still charged the dollar for the transfers. Uber refuses to give my money back, stating that I accepted the fees! The problem with that statement is of course, that I never received what I paid fees for! If they do this to all of their drivers, I don't understand how they could ever have money problems!!! True scam artists & at least one very displeased Uber ""partner"".

1,"I've been driving for Uber for a while. I believe Uber is faking its surges to charge more to customers during masked high demand times (customers pay more when demand is high during surges, however, per my experience there is considerably less demand or enough drivers showed up in the area that there is no reason to increase the rates during those surge times). I will make it simple. The following happened many time so I can tell that it was definitely not an error occasion, but a strategy to increase rates at surge times.",

She slammed brakes, skidded into left lane and with horns honking, barely missed getting hit from every direction. She shook her hands upset and started up again with traffic.",
0,"My Uber failed to show up, did not answer my phone call, and proceeded to cancel my trip. Uber then charged me a fee, with no opportunity to explain, comment, etc. I canceled my Uber account. I took a taxi. Taxi was immediately available and was no more expensive than Uber. Upon return home, I tried to reach Uber to remedy the situation. They take your money and then are virtually unreachable. I GIVE UBER ZERO STARS!",
0,"I ordered an Uber in Albany NY this morning. I selected Albany Airport as my destination. The driver arrived on time in a car that seemed dingy and small but it was supposed to be a short ride so no problem. Except that it turned out not to be a short ride at all. To reach the airport, he needed to take a right out of the parking lot and then another left at the major intersection. It's knew that it was that simple to find and I had only been in the city 3 days. He took a left out of the parking lot and I questioned him as I knew that was wrong. ",
0,"Ordering a future UBER ride and it scheduled the ride for immediately. While trying to contact driver, got message that said to leave a message. He was in front of the house before I could cancel, so I was billed $5.00 for a cancelled ride. The UBER company APP is lousy when it comes to scheduling advance rides, furthermore, when the driver arrives before you can cancel, you are still billed for the call. When trying to contact UBER directly, you cannot do it. No number exists for the city in which you are scheduling the ride and no number exists for a one to one contact to explain your situation. The only number is a help option but it does not work for complaints, only for emergencies. Not going to use Uber in the future.",
1,"Poor service and a rip-off! Yesterday I requested Uber ride service at 8:34am. At 8:37am they confirmed the request and advised the car and driver and pick up location, which was a street corner 5 minutes walk from my home, which I thought was odd for not picking me up at my home. My wife and I stood there in the direct sun waiting... then the Uber App sent me notice saying it would be another 4 minutes wait... then another notice saying it would be another 5 minutes... then another notice saying it would be 13 minutes... then another notice saying it would be 19 minutes. ",
0,"I was taken to a location that I did not request, nor had I ever heard of. The driver was very rude. Uber would not refund my money. On two prior occasions they charged me two times for one ride. I was refunded, but it was a major inconvenience.",
0,"I've been using Uber for a couple of years now, and I've got to say I'm disappointed with their customer service. I had a pool driver who never came, and as a result, I had to order a different more expensive Uber driver (at 3x the price) to get to my location on time, like I would have had the driver come on time or I had taken the train. I contacted customer service (which is a hassle in itself) and asked to be refunded the difference but was told that they â€œappreciated the feedbackâ€ but that I should have tried to use a pool or something if I was uncomfortable with the price. I'm now using Lyft because I don't have these sorts of problems.",
1,"As a driver I thought Uber was  a great company ,until I was in an accident. That is when you will find out what a lousy company they really are.Because you are  using you own vehicle they suspended my account did absolutely nothing to help me get back on the road or assist me in getting a rental car. Uber non customer service is a real joke they where a useless piece of garbage.They have a 1000 dollar deductibe you have to pay to speed up the process and they tell  you the will go after the other carries insurance company.It will be 20 days before my car is fixed.",
0,"26 April, 2018, Maryland, USA. I ordered an Uber to Dulles airport. There was no incident during the trip that resulted to a damage or spillage... No vomiting, no eating, no drinking. Beverages. I drank bottled water only. When we were dropped off at the airport, the driver did not complain of any damages neither were they any damage to his car's interior and exterior. He even dusted his entire car in our presence before taking off while we loaded our luggages in the cart. However, 12 days after the trip, Uber deducted and extra $80 from my account as cleaning fee. After writing to them and demanding clarity, I was sent a picture of a huge mess on one of the car seats. If my mom or older sister or myself made such a mess, it could not have been hidden. I am so shocked by the picture and its source. A vomit of this nature cannot go unnoticed.",
1,"Saturday, May 5th late morning, I used Uber for a 20 minute drive from my home to a high school where my chorus was performing a concert. I have used Uber a number of times in the past with positive results. I carried only a light suit bag with me. No food or drinks. I agreed to the $17 fare and was delivered without any delays. Later in the day, my email showed a double charge...two $17 charges at exactly the same time...an honest error, I thought. The next morning they emailed to notify they were correcting my charge to add an $80 cleaning fee! I am disputing this, but the truth is the driver was creating extra charges. I didn't spill or do anything to his vehicle, nor did he advise me of adding a cleaning fee. He complained endlessly during the trip of his late car payment. I won't use Uber again since this is a nearly impossible dispute. They apparently accept the drivers word with no proof.",
1,"HUGE WARNING TO UBER USERS!!! I will never use UBER again - every time I tried to add my home address, it would find it on the map and then when I would try and add it to my favorites, it kept adding a different address with the same street name in Toronto. I live north of Ottawa 4.5 hours away!!!!!!!! but that wasn't clear from their app because on the list of favorites it only shows the street name and not the town. When I first got in the Uber car, the guy went WOW , you want a drive from here to Toronto... that's 4.5 hrs. He had to manually enter the address in his system. then when I selected a 15% tip at the end of the trip, it calculated it on a fair for the original 4.5 hour trip. the $62 flashed by and I said wait a minute..It can't be that much?? He should me that the fair was $14 on his system and Uber only adds 20% so it will be less than $20. I said are you sure? He said yes. I felt dumb because it was only the second time I had used Uber so got out. After he left, I double checked my phone and saw that yes the fair was $20 but a tip of $62 was added even though I chose the 15% tip option. It must have calculated it on the original 4.5 hour fair. Now they will only give me a credit on my Uber account and NOT a refund on my card. On top of that his car was old and rattled although he was nice enough. the whole experience was bad. BEWARE!!!",
1,"If you're planning to use Uber, beware of extra added fees and know that the app is not easily understandable. You can only book a ride using their app. It does not allow you to review your ride before purchasing it. You are booking a ride unaware that you have booked it. A car shows up, you get charged and if you're not there, you get charged a $5.00 cancellation fee. Drivers are supposed to call or text you when they arrive, but some don't. They drive off because you can't find them and you get charged for the ride and another late fee. There are no human beings available to talk to when you have problems. You have to manoeuvre around in their app to send an email to customer service. This company is a money making rip off. I would not recommend using it, especially if you're not familiar with apps.",
1,"I am a driver on the Uber platform and have driven in Chicago, Illinois. Recently had my account put on hold due to a ""report of possible impairment while driving"". This is total B.S. I don't even use drugs or Alcohol. This is very disturbing for someone to write an untruthful report. I have given out over 4,000 rides and have over 2,000 5-star ratings. I receive all types of race and gender related ignorance and biases and I am vulnerable at all times unless I protect myself while I am on the road. Uber allows passengers to make false reports that affect the driver, but has no way for the driver to protect themselves from the false attacks. After research it's a drastically common issue on the Uber platform. I suggest anyone looking to drive for Uber understand that while you are an independent contractor for Uber, you will still suffer the consequences of the reality that Uber is ran like a private correctional facility.

1,I've only recently started using Uber for rides to and from work or to the next city over to visit close friends being that I do not have a car anymore. I've noticed inconsistencies in the fares as well as being blamed for the mistakes that drivers are making or that the â€œUber GPSâ€ makes. I was charged over $40 from my house to the house of a friend 10 miles away and the same ride was the same distance where I was taken 10 miles home. The ride home only cost me $21. How the HELL did it climb an extra $20? Especially when my driver got lost and passed my drop-off route. I sent a complaint hoping to get a price adjustment and was told that I basically should have told my driver not to get lost. As if it was my fault that they continued to pass my drop off point which was clearly made known before my pick up in the first place. Goodbye Uber and hello Lyft.,
1,I am uber driver uber just think about own company no support drivers plz think about then start uber its bull $#*! company,

1,"Previously, I loved Uber. I am a long haul driver and can park my tractor trailer somewhere and Uber to get food or sightsee. Here is my horror story. I'm telling it because if you use Uber, you might also want to have a Lyft account on standby. I went to IKEA in Cincinnati. After shopping, I logged in to get a ride back to my tractor 4 miles away. My payment was denied. What had happened, according to Citibank, Uber hit my card 10 times for a zero dollar amount, therefore shutting it down due to fraudulent activity. Finally, as my phone was running out of battery life, and it was getting darker and colder outside, I was able to choose a method they did take. This can happen, and the Citibank rep informed me that Uber does this a lot. Lyft not so much. If you use Uber have alternate transportation set up. If you are sightseeing know how to get back to where you need to go. Uber WILL leave you stranded.",
0,"Ubereats - My older daughter ordered food from this service, and as far as I can gather the driver, from the street, spotted her younger sister (16) on the front stoop. Not sure if he thinks he's a junior g-man or what, but he called the police and reported a child endangerment issue for her strawberry hemangioma. In case you don't know, that's a birthmark. It's not even that pronounced, and he was in his car. After a visit from the police, who seemed puzzled by the non-issue and reported everything ok - I guess it turns out not to be a police issue to have a birthmark. So, I decide to complain to the company. Guess what - NO CONTACT NUMBERS OR EMAILS available - at all. Make of that what you will. They are not welcome at my house anymore.",
1,"I started driving Uber when they opened the in Tampa, Florida market. I was issued an iPhone to utilize for driver tools. I drove a few times but quit since I was not getting the business Uber had advertised. Anyway, I received notification that they were going to charge fees for using it or I could use my smartphone for no fee. I returned the iPhone and did not drive for about 2 years.",
1,"I starting using again recently. I noticed my personal checking account balance was getting lower. I checked my statement online and Uber had been charging my personal bank card, and not my preferred business card which is my selected card. My personal card was only to used if my business account had low funds which was not the case. Uber insisted for 2 weeks that if I gave them the dates and times of the rides, they would reverse those payments, and charge the correct card. They did not do that, and then started asking to provide all of that information again and I had already done that 4 times.",
1,"We used Uber for the first time in Panama City Beach last weekend. All three drivers were wonderful. We had a blast. The first driver was so sweet and smart, his daughter called him while we were driving and he would not even talk to her because he was on the job, second guy was sweet and country and professional, third was a female, very sweet and took us right to our motel. We will be using them on our next trip. I don't get the bad reviews but I was in Florida so people may be nicer there. Thank you Uber.",

If you don't wanna be insulted don't drive for Uber. I'll never drive Uber again and I deleted my driver and rider apps. I lost more than 2000$ because of them and my credit score went 50 points down because I'm behind on my bills.",

I paid him and whilst getting down forgot my mobile left back seat. In 15 mins called my number and the driver picked up saying he has picked another passenger and is near bus terminal Mulund. I asked him if he can wait and I come by rickshaw and pick my mobile. He agreed. Bus terminal is just 10 mins from my house. I rushed, however, he was not there. Upon calling he mentioned the passenger was getting late and could not wait. I asked him how will he return my phone he asked me to call back. On calling he mentioned that I need to pay 20 rupees per kilometer to come and deliver the phone accepted. Tried calling him the full day. Finally he said shall come in the evening. Called him evening. He said, ""Have left. Please pay me. Am coming."" Accepted. Waiting. Still not arrived. ",
0,Uber has been a stellar solution for commuting in my home area of northern VA. Seems I've only had one issue and it was resolved within 24 hrs -- the driver did not use the shortest route possible. I was immediately refunded the difference. Each driver has been great in operation of the vehicle and demeanor. I've also used Uber in Washington and FL.,
0,"Do you know why their overall rating is only 2+ Stars?
Allow me to clarify:
On Tuesday I called for a car at 10am. Without bothering to confirm my address, the driver came to the wrong place and left, without a call.
Next driver cancelled, too.
My first patient cancelled.
Today, the driver actually CALLED for directions... and cancelled. No message from Uber, so I stood there, on crutches, in the snow, waiting.
Then I couldn't connect to uber, AND THERE IS NO DIRECT TELEPHONE OR COMPLAINT NUMBER.
Finally took a yellow cab.
LYFT RIDE NEXT TIME.
DUMP UBER AND MOVE TO LYFT.

0,"Uber has been gradually allowing drivers with poor reviews to work fro them.  I have had safety issues and even a driver who was clearly under the influence, among other safety issues.  When I cancel a ride due to low review scoring by other passengers, they have charged me cancellation fees and refused to refund me the $2.  This happened three times in a row where I cancelled those trips within less than 24 hours.  Lyft allows me to cancel trips if I do not like the driver's review score and has now configured me to ride with drivers with a 4.6 score or above.  I will try Lyft, Cabify, Juno or Via before choosing Uber as I am sure other companies will come into the market and provide much better services to compete with Uber.",

The dangerous one was a driver in Philadelphia who did not have enough room in her old car for my luggage, had the rap music turned up so loud I could not hear my phone, and she texted all the way to the airport. But overall they have been pretty good. Toronto has drivers that I can not even understand due to their accents. The cities that I find best are Phoenix, Denver and Las Vegas.",

I have to cross reference with UberX first to ensure no surging then make pool request. So I did that like normal and the price was 11-16, so I figured the pool should be at least less than 11.

They wanted to satisfy me with a $5.00 credit for the whole inconvenience. Seriously... Very unreliable and not very worried about customer safety and satisfaction.",
0,"I called and set up my Uber ride. As I was waiting for him, I saw that he was making wrong turns and driving away from me. I called his contact number and received a message from his phone that he was not receiving calls at this time, so I texted him that he was going the wrong way, he did not respond. I then saw that he was just sitting, not moving anymore. I texted him again and he still did not respond. After a while I cancelled the ride and re-order a new ride, who got to me in 3 minutes.",
1,"Uber is one of the most shady unethical companies ever created. I stopped driving for them over a year ago, but decided to try UberEats as a delivery person. I figured it would be better because I wouldn't have to drive people - boy was I wrong. First, they take 35% of every delivery. Then they don't have enough delivery drivers so I noticed I was driving 15 to 20 mins to reach a restaurant (which you are not compensated for), to pick up an order that is being delivered to a location that may be 2 to 3 mins away. Giving the driver a whopping $2.86 for that delivery. I have also gone to pick up orders only to arrive at the restaurant, to find out the order was cancelled and Uber doesn't compensate the driver with a cancellation fee. The order still showed active in my app, but nobody took the time to notify me.",

1,I want to start off by saying I will never use uber again ! First off every time I take a trip I know the rate is a certain price doesn't matter that I go home at a certain time of the day I know it has always been this price I been riding this specific route for some time but today took that same trip & literally price said the same thing & so the price is between 15 to 16 bucks & so literally get in the uber of course & literally was having problems with the app cause there always some problem with there app & got home to my place to look & see that I was charged 37 for my ride when I was charged wrong for like the 4th or 5th time before it has happened they reversed it now they could not reverse it so in short screwed me over & now they are talking about they said I went past my location when I didn't so now I'm letting everyone know do not use uber because they are disrespectful & will not reverse me for money,

much better then uber 
no surge pricing ever",
1,They are not giving there service in Kanpur ...  #The 11th Biggest city...  Very very poor ....Why is it if they take money out of your account for the Uber rides that they have to take additional money which they say it's an authorization hold but they do not put it back for at least eight days and this is money that I cannot access and another thing if you have an Uber gift card they still want to put monies from the ride from your checking account on hold when it is confirmed that they will get paid by the Uber gift card ...I just Uber Cabs .....,

She dropped me off at a Hotel on the strip. I soon realized I left my phone in her car. Gone! - You can't get in touch with Uber by phone. She won't return it. I am going to call the LVMPD and report it stolen. And get the security video. This is Horse Manure!!! - What the hell is wrong with people (some). You're fired!",
0,How do they keep getting away with things. I use Uber everyday multiple times a day. I've had drivers blow stop signs and drive recklessly etc. I needed an Uber the other night so I used my app and I was connected to Mohammed. He immediately calls me to tell me he is over 20 min. away even though my app which has always been accurate said he is 12 min. away. I told him I would wait. 30 min. later since he obviously took his sweet ** time he pulls up more than halfway up the block. I walk towards him and as I'm about to open the door on the driver's passenger side he drives off. He actually could've hit me and hurt me. I called him repeatedly with no answer. He then pulls up on the other end of the block on a main road. As I speed walk towards him waving my arms he drove off again. I then saw him drive by again and drive around the neighborhood and park around the block from me as you can see it on the app. I called him but nothing. ,
1,"First, I want to say, I've used Ubers for a few months and NEVER had a problem. Wanted to write what happened and let others know Uber is great! A friend always used Uber in Phila. I had no idea what it was. I recently moved to Florida - took a trip back home to Phila. via Tampa airport. The cost for an Uber to airport was $27 and I gave a tip. On my way back from the Tampa airport, I would also use an UBER. WRONG! Again, NO IDEA that Ubers were not allowed near the Airport. After my flight got in LATE evening, I got online to summon an Uber... the site would not pull up. I tried again and again to no avail.",
1,"I had the experience of being stolen from by an Uber customer, despite contacting Uber, using the police as legally expectations, Uber has declined to give the police the information they need to prosecute their thieving customer. It's sad that Uber came into the Kenyan market and is above the Kenya police. They have made it impossible to get reprieve on crimes committed by their drivers, and customers. To get to their security team is an email nightmare. They have no phone communication and have a confused staff who keep sending junk mail despite the complaints.",

1,"Be careful as Uber is getting sloppy with overcharges, not providing credits, and charging Cancellation fees when it was not me who canceled. This All happened within the last week. Uber was late in arrival twice in the last week. They sent me a text message each time stating they would credit the next fare. It was only $1.99 for each ride. I never keep the text messages as I don't remember having this sort of problem. I ride quite a bit so I didn't think anything of the credits until the a couple days after the 2nd ride.",
0,"We all know Uber is lousy (try Lyft instead), but here's another example: Arriving at the Fort Lauderdale airport, tried to do an Uber. It was accepted by the driver, then they called and cancelled saying it was too early for them. They told me to go to the app and cancel it myself (I assume so they could charge me and not get in trouble for cancelling a ride). This happened a second time with a different driver exactly the same. Then finally the 3rd one arrived. Uber didn't charge my credit card for the 2 cancelled fees, instead they charged it for the entire amount of the 2 rides I didn't take and they list it on their site as a cancelled, so if I wasn't paying close attention to my credit card transactions, it would have gone unnoticed.

1,We had a flight at SFO and uber never arrived at the time we ask to be picked up. They sent me three different messages they said that they would be 15 minutes then 35 minutes then 45 minutes. We cansal and drove ourselves and miss our flight. I sent  sent my complain and they said that the driver was on time. I don't know why they could not see the message that the driver sent  and at what time I needed to be picked up. Never gain I will use there service. I will never recommend them.,

I opened a Uber account, added a promo code, and thought I was set for my first trip, wrong! I was refused pick up 5 times and was stranded. I tried walking but my legs gave way and fell on the side of the road, a stranger helped me and gave me a ride home. I contacted the company and they stated the account problem is fine on next ride. I was dropped off by a family member before his work, then called Uber again, and again I was refused a ride so I had to pay 25.00 out of pocket as I had my granddaughter which had to be dropped off home then myself.",

I take an Uber pool that clearly quoted $2.99(I have a screenshot) and was charged $41.00. I contacted Uber customer service which sucks and was told the driver had an issue which prevented this trip from being timed according to proper pick up and drop off. It clearly states $2.99 and they felt ""the driver had to be compensated"". This company is putting out fake advertisements and charging a totally different fee without the customer's consent.",
1,"Here is what I sent. ""I am sick of your fraudulent charging cancellation fees. When I cancel within SECONDS of ordering a car, a pop-up warns that there ""may"" be a fee for canceling more than 5 MINUTES After ordering. Yet you regularly charge a cancellation fee. I have asked your customer service people to escalate to your Legal department. This is an illegal practice. Then I have to dispute the charges. You are gambling that most people won't complain or won't notice. I notice. Today I canceled two cars within seconds of ordering because the eta was too long. I got charged and your customer service is refusing to refund me this ILLEGAL charge. Disgusting. I will inform every legal authority I can think of in order to protect the public. Meanwhile I demand a refund for my two appropriate (per YOUR rules) cancellations.""",

0,"Supposedly Uber is meant to be cashless per their response below, unless you got my driver ""**"", The ride from Boca TOOJAY's Deli on Glades Rd to WPB started with a stop at a gas station where the driver complained the cost to pay cash vs credit card was $.25 more per gallon... The ride then went well until we arrived in WPB where the drive said ""I"" do not that credit cards when I offered him my card. This was fine, as I always carry cash. I asked how much, he said like, like $42 to which I said fine. I handed the driver $60 and asked for $10 back. He said he did not have a $10 and offered me a few ones....",
1,"My Uber ride from my home to Wal-Mart was enjoyable. I paid $7.80. After shopping, I turned on the Uber app to request a ride. Everything was normal until the moment I pressed ""request ride"". The app moved to view the airport and asked me to select my location. I backed out and tried again, and the app still insisted that I select a location within the airport. Funny thing... There was a blue dot on my REAL PICK up location, but the app was not allowing me to click on the blue dot. When I manually entered my location, it still swung back to the airport!!! I had my 2 yr old with me and had no choice to agree to the ridiculous overcharging. When I brought this to Uber's attention, I was dismissed and they gave me a response of ""It was higher because of the demand for the Uber service""... Yeah... OK!!! Long story, I was ripped off and Uber gives no **. I am NOT using this service ever again.",
1,"I have been driving only two months but done with uber.  I noticed how unfair the prices, pay is so I decided to ask passangers to send me via text how much they actually paid (after they got the email with how much their actual fare was) and time and time again what I got paid based on fare was off by $1-4 on each trip!  They steal from the drivers!  Not only they take their 20% they take more!  When you report it on each trip they come back and say oh ok the fare will be adjusted, not only they adjust it wrong but you never see that money, ever.  When will that adjustment hit your account?  Never!  Be aware, you will pay more then 20% take, it's more like 35% most rides because if like the passanger pays $10 in reality they paid like 13-14$!",
1,Undisclosed charges and fees - This company does not offer support to its driver partners. They adjust fare payments without giving the driver notice and close http links to access driver support and withhold account information. I haven't received full payment for service rendered and can not reach a live person or received a chat response to resolve it.,
0,"Two days ago I took a trip with Uber in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. I normally use this service every day. Another passenger with me on the trip forgot their phone in the car. Since then we have sent about 20 messages to Uber Customer service. They finally determined that the driver found the phone but we are still waiting for it to be returned. Uber and the driver now have my direct contact information and yet the only way I can get any feedback is through the Uber Customer Service system. I think that in such cases Uber should make it easier for the driver and customer to communicate directly. I will no longer be using Uber or recommending their services after this incident. We just want our item returned and I no longer trust this service, its reliability or safety rating.",

The return was a nightmare, I was watching the driver going around in circles. I tried calling him but he did not answer. He finally called me, I could barely understand him. He wanted me to meet him almost a block away. I told him I have and disability and needed him to pick me up in front of Clyde's, he then just cancelled my ride.",
1,"Just wrote about the ""high"" driver going to downtown Nashville.  Wanted also to mention the ride back to hotel.  The 2nd driver was a young man looked to be around early 20's.  The car was very old and although it seemed cleaned out, it smelled horrible.  The thick stench of cigarettes literally made me sick.  We tried to converse with him and he hardly said two words. He really gave me a ""creepy"" feeling... like we were in a car with someone with ""serious mental issues"" (only nice way to put it) .   I think I'd feel safer in a regular Taxi any day.   I have to say though that I had a really good experience with two drivers I used in Destin, FL.  But the two I got in Nashville made me not want to chance Uber ever again.",
0,"Regardless of what Uber says... they could care less about driver earnings, they are just interested in signing up new drivers. Last Saturday night, in Ocean City Maryland... a coastal town which runs about 7 miles long had 11 drivers. That is one for every 2000 feet of roadway. That is nothing but total BS. About every three days I get a message from Uber offering a $350 bonus if I refer a new driver and they make 50 trips. Hey Uber... how about concentrating on the drivers you have and making your driver app work?",
1,"Uber doesn't care for its drivers. So UBER doesn't take any fuel charges for over 2 weeks, then sends a letter explaining how it was their fault and they will correct the problem over two pay periods only take all the fuel charges from me in one pay. And on top of that, riders damage my vehicle and UBER tells me pay $1,000 deductible to file a claim. They overcharge riders on the upfront pricing and takes over 25% of nearly all rides over 2 miles. And it's not fair that driving at night subjects me to being rated by drunk racists who in turn are the deciding factors to whether I am able to continue driving on the platform.",

Was already costing me enough and I was disrespected due to being trans and the driver stopped on the way never stopping the meter so I was charged  extra .

I have been back and forth via e-mail with Uber and have tried everything that they have told me to, but nothing is working. I have since had to pay out $47 in transportation costs because I cannot use my Uber credit. It shows up on my account but won't process. Uber has not been able to give me any solution nor have they attempted to refund my money. I don't have money to just give away, I want my $30 back.

0,"Uber driver was late and stopped 50 meters ahead of where he was supposed to be. We wave him down but he doesn't come. We call him, he doesn't talk but hangs up then a couple of seconds later starts moving towards us at 5km/h
 I question if he is ok when he arrives as he seems either drunk or sleepy or just completely spaced out. I don't want to risk the lives of myself and my partner and her  
 5 year old son. Driver gets aggressive and doesn't want to drive us anymore after we waited for him for so long. I tell him not to yell as he is scaring the 5 year old and its at this moment that he cancels the trip and orders us to get out of his car.
 The 5 year old boy is getting out of the car with one leg on the ground when the driver decides to accelerate. This fool is playing a game with his 1500kg car and a 20kg child. We yell at him and I put the car in park so that he cant harm anyone. We advised him we will be taking it up with the Police.
 Its at this moment, like an infant, this driver begins playing the victim and starts pacing around his car while its in the middle of the road with doors open and hazards on. A tantrum for the adult who realises what he has done is wrong and illegal.
 I have contacted uber and am awaiting their call. If I'm not happy I have an active social media presence and will escalate to the proper ombudsmen as well as the police.
 I REALLY hope uber do not defend this dangerous and irresponsible individual and resolve this quickly.
 Very very disappointed and angry,....
edit: Update - uber customer service (if you can call it that) is abysmal. They are siding with the driver and banning the passenegers account whilst not revealing ANYTHING about their 'investigation' hiding behind their privacy policy.  strongly considering posting the pics and videos of the driver and his car online.
Customer service rep was Abhi who didn't provide us with any resolution and in fact just made things much much worse. Please don't pretend to care about dangerous behaviour if you clearly don't...",
1,"Used Uber probably about 10 times. 98% of the time they arrived almost 30 minutes late and ended up at the wrong destination. They didn't pay attention to the sign on the road showing the address nor did they have a reliable means of locating such a simple address. Absolutely ridiculous! In the last few times I used them they also added a booking fee of $2.50. Unimpressed! In speaking with the drivers, they're not from the area and don't know where they are going. Relying solely on a GPS. One driver didn't even know his bearings, N, S, E, W. That baffled me to no end. As a result of this crappy service, I've cancelled my account with them. Local cabs are only a few dollars more, arrive on time and know EXACTLY where they are going!!!",
0,This damn service has been charging me for rides that I haven't used!!! I just notice that on my bank statement that Uber been charging me 3 to 4 rides a week.

We gave him $60 unknowingly that they are paid in advanced over the phone with a secured credit card payment. He knew darn well it must of been a mistake. No way anyone tips $60 for a 10 minute ride. He did not say anything. The driver kept the money.",
0,I've been driving for Uber for a while now and the Uber navigation application is a total disappointment. When you accept a rider request the address for the rider disappears from the application screen leaving you at the mercy of the Uber application which doesn't navigate very well. So you don't have time to enter it in your vehicle GPS application. Then the Uber application routes you to the wrong location and doesn't understand what direction your car is actually going I used both Google maps and Waze applications and had the same issue. The Uber application doesn't interface with either well and has you going in circles quite often. Uber will waste your time and money when you make some. Uber gets a big portion of it in fees. They should have done a better job of development. My car GPS runs circles around Uber's application and has no problems getting me to specific addresses. So what's wrong with Uber's application?,

He was not telling the proper destination and on further inquiring, got to know that it was not 2 mins but 10-15 mins. I also got to know that the driver was moving to opposite direction.

Why would I used Uber again if they screwed me up? I think it's not my fault if they did not fulfill the contract that they will be at my place in 5-9 minutes. That's why I have to cancel the trip otherwise I will stick to it.",
1,"Well when I sign up with Uber I was looking for some extra income on the side. In the beginning it started pretty slow, but I figured some things out to make decent money using Uber. Like some of the previous reviews the money you make doesn't really cover all of your expenses like gas, car maintenance, etc. For example your total trip fee is 407.80 - Uber fee 103.21 = my actual earnings 304.59 - gas $70 = 234.59 for about 27 online hours. Which comes out to be about 8.69/hr below minimum wage. I put up with it because I needed the money. ",

That time, I took the screenshot which shows the request comes from surge sides but no surge appears. I send these information to Uber. Uber still says no and this was not in the surge side and asking me customer's name. I don't save customers name or any information of customers. I said like I know which trip was it and I sent the trip information I have to them. They still says what was the customer's name, trip date or whatever. They don't give my money.",

1,"Uber for me is so buggy that I can simply not use it. I can not get my head around how a billion dollar company can not build a working app or website. 
Bug (design flaw) 1: you need to request permission through support to use the mobile website as a rider.
Bug 2: right now, the entire help.uber.com website is down. For hours. What?!
Bug 3: once you've been granted ""permission"" to use the mobile web-interface for rides, there is no way to change your phone number. There's an ""edit"" button for the phone number on the non-mobile website, but this then tells you to go to the app (which you can't use, that's why you're using the mobile site, durrrr).
Bug 4 (design flaw): once you've signed up with Uber there is no easy online way to delete your Uber account. I've looked into this and you actually need to contact support (the same support who's webpage is completely down right now) and write them an email saying you want your account deleted. Really?! In 2017? They're a billion dollar company but their website and software is worse than that written by a startup full of 12 year olds in their moms basement. I feel sorry for any talented coders working under Uber's obviously out of control ""manage""ment.",

""we understand that you had a question about requesting an exception to our requirement for a valid State driver's license. I'm afraid that we are currently unable to allow exceptions to this requirement. We know that Active Duty Service Members may relocate frequently. While many local regulations recognize this, these terms do not necessarily apply beyond personal driving.""
There is nothing wrong with my license, I am not asking for an exemption. My license is valid. 
On top of that I had to jump through hoops to get my account reset because when I drunkenly set it up the first time I put in the wrong email.
So I am beyond fed up with this company. I'm moving to Lyft!",

1,I am a single mother of a three month old baby trying to get back on my feet. Long story short I got a job working full-time. I am staying at Motel 6 and was taking Uber to drop off my baby and go to work every day. The first day it cost $4 to go 2 blocks to the babysitter and then $11 to get to work. I had to borrow money for the next two weeks for rides and then pay them back when I get paid. Well the next day it was $9 to get to the babysitter and then $20 to get to work. I had no idea that they price gouged according to demand and now I don't have enough money for rides... Thanks a lot UBER!,
0,My daughter left her new boots (Blundestones) in an Uber cab in Toronto. When she got home she realized they were missing from all the luggage. She texted the driver but he did not reply. We were on our way out of the country on a family vacation for two weeks so she had no contact until our return. She went into the head office in Toronto and they contacted the driver. He did admit to finding the boots and also admitted to giving them to a family member who lives in B.C. ,
0,"On January 6 I rode my first ride with Uber. I got my first uber ride and it said it was 4 minutes away. We went down to meet him and I followed him on the map. He finally came to the place where we got it and he kept circling the place for five minutes so I called Bewkete and asked him if he needed directions and he told me, ""No. I'll be there later."" So I waited and saw that he left then started going in the opposite direction we were going and went out 5 miles away. So I called him again and he didn't answer. So he texted me back saying, ""I'll talk to you later.""",
1,"I am now writing this review as NOT ONE PERSON AT UBER is assisting me. I have now for 9 weeks not being paid for my ETA's, I am absolutely disappointed. When us as Uber partners don't accept each and every request, it affects our profile, but yet, Uber does not come to the party? Why are ETA's not being paid? Why has Uber not been making efforts to look after their Partners the way the Partners look after Uber?",
0,"On Wednesday 11th January (@ 6:19PM) I booked Uber Cab and Uber app showed waiting time approx 10 mins, in between I then checked my mails for 2-3 mins, and when I opened Uber app again (after 4mins) it showed nothing (means it looked like no cab was booked, and in fact I didn't see booked cab details). I then opened Uber app and booked the cab again (@6:26 PM) and successfully trip completed.",
1,I have been driving with Uber for over three months. I have great reviews from passengers who I have dropped off at many locations all around Orlando. I strongly recommend that no one drives with Uber. They are complete rip off. You will spend more money on gas and put so many miles on your car that you don't even make enough to fill your tank back up and on top of that if there's a rude passenger which Uber does not confirm who the passenger is. They will cause damage to your car and once he reported to Uber they will tell you that he sent it off to an insurance adjuster and I did no longer responsible. Any insurance adjuster will tell you that you have to pay $1000 or more to fix your own car. They don't want to take responsibility for anything and when you sign up for Uber it clearly states that they are responsible for damages caused by passengers.,
1,I had my rating at 4.8 with 2500 plus rides and no complaints from Uber for 5 months. I uploaded this video which is on this page created by somebody else. Within few days I received an email from Uber and they wanted to talk over the phone... To my surprise because they never have live person that you can talk. Told the guy that they need to provide me with a lawyer and that they must pay for high tech cameras so I can protect myself while driving for Uber. They said that they will not do anything and following day they shut down my access and couple months later they discontinued my partnership for violating company policy. To this day I don't know what I did and they refused to provide AAPD with all the records... Stating that none can be found.,
1,Booked a ride with them and was not taken to correct location. Contacted for a refund. They gave a refund and 4 days later increased the amount of the fare and charged my account again. Now refusing to correct the situation. I will never use or recommend Uber again. I'd rather walk 10 miles!,
1,The service and availability is good but they put exorbitant fare almost every day. Practically useless for daily commuters.,
1,"This review is not just about the airport pick up, but in general for people who wish to know how to travel.
The best and only taxi company that I would recommend is Blue Bird, they are great! They always use the meter and the drivers are professional
The other taxi companies (dark blue, purple, grey colour taxis, not the light blue - blue bird taxis) are all rip offs!  Be careful, they are scammers and rude 99% of the time.
Ok now onto Uber, it can be great and it can be not so great, I would say 75% of the time it is good, but if you get one of these drivers look out -
Booked a Uber ride at 6.09pm with driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya"" to pick up from Nikki Beach Club, after waiting at the front of the club for 10 mins it was clear he was not coming as his vehicle which was 1km away was not moving in our direction, but I was surprised when the app changed to being on the journey, a few minutes later it finished but I was charge 15,000 rah (of course you waste time and write to uber the they refund it, but why should loyal passengers need to go through such crap when it is clearly not their fault?)
I then booked Uber again at 6.19pm, the same driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya"" accepted the booking but this time, he messages me on WhatsApp to tell me unless i pay cash he is not coming, so I try to change the payment method to cash but this is not allowed on the Uber app, so when I tell the driver this he says unless I pay him cash he will not come!!  He then asked me to cancel, but luckily it is within the 5 min BS time limit so I am not charged a cancellation fee this time (even though again it is not my fault!)
I advised the driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya"" that the service is terrible, he told me he does not care and when I said I would report this service to Uber he said ""I do not fear"", clearly Uber does not care for passenger service and is happy to hire anyone in Bali as a driver, as I would never employee someone with such an attitude, especially when now 18 hours later he just sent me another offence message to my phone ""You Emang Top""
Anyway avoid the driver ""I Dewa Made Satrya""with phone number +62 821 4407 1347
I then attempted to make another booking, this time it was picked up by driver ""Nyoman"", this booking was at now 6.29pm, this driver was 8 minutes away and started driving to my location, so I was thinking great finally have a driver, he was within about 3 minutes away and then I noticed he kept going passed the turn off and when I contacted him he said he is not coming, I could see on the app he was like 3 mins away, then 6 mins, 9 min, 12 min and clearly not coming to Nusa Dua but driving to Ulawatu, this driver just ignored all contact from me via message/phone, just keep driving and I guess waiting for me to cancel, which I finally did, clearly another driver that does not care for passenger service
Please avoid ""Nyoman"" driver and his number is +62 812 3786 5029, he clearly does not care and should not be allowed to drive for Uber.
Ok so finally made another booking with Uber, it is now 6.40pm, the guy turns up, very nice driver, but as I got into the car and sat down my daughter was just getting into the car and the driver starts to drive off, without her being in the car, the door was still open, my daughter then hit the road and was left on the street, this was clearly an accident but careless driving from Uber, I will not write his name, as he was nice, but clearly not careful.
Anyway basically after about 4 bookings, waiting 40 minutes, writing to uber for refund for my 15,000 Rph, we made it home to the villa in seminyak.
Honestly i love Uber, use it all over the world, however, I think in some cities like China (especially Beijing), Bali and Sydney the server now is terrible and the prices are on the increase so a taxi can be about the same!!!!  Once uber gets the marketshare they want they increase the prices without warning!",
1,Why is it if they take money out of your account for the Uber rides that they have to take additional money which they say it's an authorization hold but they do not put it back for at least eight days and this is money that I cannot access and another thing if you have an Uber gift card they still want to put monies from the ride from your checking account on hold  when it is confirmed that they will get paid by the Uber gift card. I have for three weeks been trying to resolve this problem on two separate situations and the customer service is horrible. Isn't it illegal for them to keep a hold on your  money even after they get paid for the services of an Uber driver taking you to your destination. And why does it take so long for it to drop off from your checking account they should confirm you have the money then debit your account for the Uber ride and then that's it. I am trying to find out  how to issue an official complaint against Uber because of the situation can you please help,
1,"I started driving with Uber late October 2016. My first week I worked 80 hours, grossed $220., paid $25. Of that in fuel. Put a lot of wear and tear on my brand new Toyota Corolla. Those of you riders that complain about service, remember, you get what you pay for. For me, I realized what a terrible company Uber is for drivers. I wouldn't drive for them again ever.",
0,"Uber drivers are cheater. I must say that my sister left her phone while boarding to a cab. At first side cab driver is ready to give her phone after his shift over, but on the second day, he denies to do it. I need a resolution asap. Otherwise, I will go to police against the company. As a proof, I have everything in call recording.",
1,"We used Uber to travel 8.2 miles from our hotel to downtown Nashville on New Years Eve. The fare was approximately $15 which was reasonable. When we were ready to leave on New Years Day the Uber app showed because of the high demand our fare increased to 9.7 times. It was raining and there we did not see other choices (taxi's, buses, Lyft) available so I agreed to this. Our bill to go back to our hotel was over $140.00. I received an invoice from our first fare of $15.00 but I never received an invoice from the $140.00 fare. I emailed Uber about the invoice and did not receive a response. Nothing that I read in the Uber app discussed this and I feel this is completely underhanded of Uber to pull this kind of a stunt.",
0,"My first experience with uber was absolutely horrible. A driver by the name of Wylder picked up myself and a friend and we were under the impression this was a safe, comfortable and convenient way to get to our location. It was not. The car (ford focus) was in horrible shape, the seats were tore up and covered in nasty stains. The vehicle smelled like cigarette smoke so bad I could hardly breath, and the driver was very unprofessional. He didn't use GPS and asked if we minded if he picked up a 3rd passenger on our way, we accepted since there was room, but then Wylder drove around for 30+ min looking for this other potential ""client"". He finally drove back to the location that he picked us up at and said ""I am suppose to be looking for a girl named Brittany""... umm, That would be me! He didn't seem to know what he was doing one bit. I felt very unsafe with his driving ability as he was all over the road and made sharp sudden turns in the wrong direction on several occasions. With this being my first experience with uber, I was very dissatisfied and probably wont be using the services again",
1,"I drive for uber in Orlando. My car is always clean, safe and I received a lot of great feedback from passengers. I driven all over Orlando many times very late at night only for uber to keep all my earning and display that I owe them. I've had to spend for a lot of gas and tolls, new breaks, tires, deep cleaning because of messes made by  some passengers and when I ask where are my earnings I get a bs response. It's as if I been doing favors for people driving them around all for nothing. I'm going to find out who I can talk to so I can file suit again uber",
1,"I was driving for Uber. They said you will make it $1500.00 a week, this is true lie. Working up to 75 hours a week and my salary $500 a week. In two months my car was destroyed over 20.000 miles. That is ridiculous how uber trick people, after I spent more than $7.000 now my car is to hold. Uber is a big rip off company and I never recommend to nobody to work for uber. If you do that you will be really disappointed. Please don't waste your time.",
1,"Driving for Uber is depressing and not satisfying. I would say 20% to 30% of people are completely irrational and have unrealistic expectations. Driving rich, hollow, and entitled people in my car is not a joy. After making a small comment to a rider about living on a hill I was asked to turn up the radio immediately. I laughed at how rude the exchange was. I picked up a lady from a BMW dealership. She told me the dealership booked her a ride. She immediately told me she was not pleased with the car, that she likes nice cars even though the car is clean 2015 Honda Civic.",
1,I love the convenience offered by these cabs. It has taken a while for me to catch on the trend but I'm now using Uber for most of my in town commutes. Highly recommended for every person on the move. Regards,
0,"Dec 23, 2016 I was leaving a domestic situation and I was having car trouble. My daughter called Uber for me. I unknowingly dropped my car keys in the driver car. He showed up the next day at my daughter's house while I was at work with my key. My daughter called me and said the driver was demanding $25 for my key because he turned off his meter to bring my keys. Before she could get license plate number he drove off. I complained on the Uber support website and no response. How can he get away with this. Have no way to get in my car now. What is he gaining by keeping my key. Why come to the house and not return my key.",

0,"I requested an Uber ride on Thursday the 15th 2016 to take me from my home in Apopka Vineland to a Dentist Office in Dr. Phillips. The Uber arrived and took me to an address that I explained to him did not appear to be the correct address as it appeared to be that of a private home in a private neighborhood instead. I tried to explain this to the Uber driver, however, very rudely he requested assured me that that was the correct address. I got out of the vehicle to check the place out and see if it was the office, but, the Uber turned around and left me there (IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE!!!!) 
I contacted Uber on their contact line to tell them about their experience on repetitive occasions, however, to this day 23rd of the month no one ever did. This is quite unbelievable for me as I have been riding with Uber for a long time and dedicated; but if I ever have something like an outstanding balance with them they never play to hurry notify me for their funds. All I wanted was for someone to return my messages so I could state my case. Was that too much to ask for???",
0,"Emailed them about an issue with Uber Pool (Driver name Tejan in Mitsubishi Lancer in DC metro area on Saturday night at 8:14pm) and was promised internal investigation  but they didn't contact me after that, shared a trip with another 3 people instead of 2, all drunk, one of them with a drink in his hand. I am a girl and was not willing to make an issue and was hoping the driver will do something but he didn't open his mouth to stop the F Words coming from the mouth of the men instead he opened the window and let us freeze in the cold because of alcohol smell. Inappropriate touching due to us crammed in the back, their girlfriend was in between but the guy with a drink kept his arms around her reaching to my shoulder. Uber customer service is a joke.",
1,"I drive for uber since my last job ended and so far Uber has been the worst company to imagine. I always notice that most of my payments has not been complete, either they pay far much less than expected or give me less than what I actually pay for toll. Just Thursday 12/15 I picked a lady from Wellesley to Newbery Boston and it took me 24 miles and 42 mnts to get to the destination after driving 6 miles to pick up. This useless company gave me $8.04. Since then I tried contacting them but they keep giving computer-tailored message. Am planning a lawsuit against them and if you Uber driver and been cheated and feel same that this company is a fraud reach out to me.",
1,"VERY UNPROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE FROM UBER'S SUPPORT. On 12th December 2016, I have registered with Uber and uploaded a valid credit card. On the same day. The same day, Uber disabled my account and suspended too. There is no Phone Number listed to contact Uber Support. The only mode of correspondence is email communications. Uber support team never gave a valid reason for suspending my account. This is nothing but HARRASMENT on part of an International Company.

While waiting for the ride, which was 7 minutes away when we ordered it, the driver cancelled for some reason. We had to reorder the ride. And we got the same driver, who did come a few minutes later. The ride home was no problem, but we got a cancellation fee of $10 that showed up on our credit card transactions. ",
0,"If you only need Uber for a ride your fine. However, I use them for my grocery trips. Drivers have left me to carry 15 grocery bags to my door my myself. If you don't mind being dropped on the curb (disabled) trying to figure out how the hell your going to get all your stuff in your house without hurting yourself I guess there fine.

1,"On Dec 4 2016 in the evening I ordered a Uber car. Address was on the corner of 16th street in front of the Union Square Cafe... Approx 7:30 pm... going to Penn Station. Two of us. We could not find the driver and I attempted to call him. He got frustrated and cursed me. He told me I was a ""** stupid person"". His name began with a G. I was mortified. How dare he talk like that. I did contact you and never received a response. I was charged $5.00 twice on my PayPal account. I want him punished and spoken to. I also expect a refund for services I did not receive. After this incident I signed up for LYFT. I will try them out.",
0,It's nice that Uber can help people to bring where they want to go. But I am not happy much so when they don't give back cancellation fees and trip that never take still. They charge. Some drivers are good but some they are not. Start a trip without being pick up is sucks because they will charge you no matter what. Also some drivers they don't know how to used GPS and take you a long trip which fees getting higher and change without knowing it. Hope they can fix it and return Riders Money because that is stealing on Uber Part.,
0,"For myself Uber has been a pleasant surprise. After reading through a hundred plus reviews and watching a few YouTube related videos(hysterical). I found myself uncertain if I wanted to join the Uber Brigade. The reviews seemed for the most part, to be negative. Not enough pay, a lot of down time etc. For myself, Everytime I flip on the Uber app it's non stop, until I stop. However I live in Toronto and I only use it part time. I have a full time gig. If I work Uber its 2 to 4 hrs a night Monday to Thursday at ""rush hour"".Friday I go 5pm until 10pm and start back up at 2-2:30am and work for a few more hours. Saturday repeat and Sunday is always busy up until 4pm. The rate varies for me but I base it by the day. It's been as low as $18 an hour and as high as $35 an hr. I don't always work the best times but I'm still averaging $21 an hr. After my first month. If you work the right times you can make $25-35 an hour, for me a perfect effortless part time job. The people are great. I always offer water and candy.  Anyway if you're reading this and contemplating just check it out what do you have to lose. Here's my reference number you'll receive a minimum $50 incentive after your first 10 rides. Or at least that's what my incentive was. I believe it varies by city but anyone can use it https://partners.uber.com/join/?city=Toronto&invite_code=nqrh6fgpue",

I want my personal info off this site. I believe my identity has been stolen by an Uber employee as well as fraud being committed.  If this is true, this employee has used my name my SSN, my DOB and my DL# to apply for credit accounts.
Thus far this person has has applied for 3 credit cards: Target, Finger Hut and Pay Pal. I found out this news today. A person of high authority at UBER needs to find out which Uber employee has stolen my identity and committed fraud. 
I began my Uber Driver application on  August 31st.  The city I applied to to drive in is Albuquerque, NM.  Thus far my application is incomplete.  I did provide my DOB, SSN and DL#. Additional, I provided a picture of my driver's license. 
Furthermore, the phone number that has been texting me daily is *******524.
Please investigate this illegal matter promptly as well as respond back to me ASAP.

Delete my Active Partner Albuquerque Account IMMEDIATELY. I do not want other any other UBER Employeesor hackers to steal my identity.

From my my DL this personhas my previous address (which is only on DL), my DOB, my DL #
Additionally, as I stated before you should beinvestigating your employees who have access to my personalinformation.  I did file a police reportfor identity theft on 9/21/16.  I foundout about my identity theft on the 9/20/16.

Lastly, I do not understand how it is possible for me to have an active account when I have not provided my car insurance nor have I had by vehicle inspected.
Thank you,

Good Morning Silas,
At the top of the last email that you sent me what did the following statement mean: ""Your request (192809225) has been updated.""  Does this mean that all my account information has been deleted as I have twice requested? If it has not been, please provide confirmation that it has been. Or what is the specific task that has been updated?  
I know as yesterday, that UBER still has my email address because I received the following email which is below:
Concerning the text that I have been getting daily from *******524 is this number an official UBER number and is the following address for vehicle inspection legitimate: 2300 Centre Ave. SE, Albuquerque, NM 87106?

Hi Danielle,
Happy to help here.
I do apologize for the trouble, but we're unable to have the riders' account deleted due to the fact that you have a drivers' account that is active.
So what I'll do is send your drivers' account to the respective team and have it cancelled then do the same for the riders' account.
So just sit tight while we look after this for you.
Speak soon.

1,"I started driving for Uber on November 17. I took them up on their offer to rent a car through Enterprise. I have seen the charges on my account where the vehicle is being paid for/deducted out. This past weekend, Uber temporarily deactivated my account because my vehicle registration and insurance ""expired"". I resubmitted my documents several times and only received a generic response about how they were invalid. I had no recourse based on these email responses until the following Monday when the local office opened back up, which prevented me from working the whole weekend.

Overall I would not recommend any1 to work for uber as it is low pay drivers have no advantage 
Rider can claim everything",
1,"After my credit card info was stolen and charged via Uber, fortunately the amount was refunded. But my nightmare didnt stop there. Soon I found my Uber account was inaccessible and they replied that I need to email them the scanned copies of my government ID and credit card. I told them that would expose me to bigger risk and willing to meet their local employee if necessary. They sent me this ""I've reviewed your account. It appears that your account has been suspended for activity that violates our Terms and Conditions and will be unavailable for you to use until further notice. We will let you know if we will consider lifting the suspension."" Do I smell some sabotage there? I violated T&C because I am trying to protect myself not sending my credit card?",
1,"On December 10, 2016, my son used Uber for same ride he takes monthly to NYS Army National Guard located at 60-80 Lexington Avenue, New York City. I was shocked that I was charged $48.34. Normally the trip averaged between $18-30, always pooled, you can see based on trips this year: 12/10/16 - pickup on Albany Ave, Bklyn NY, drop off National Guard located 60-70 Lexington Avenue, NY. Time: pickup 4:27 am, $48.34. 11/4/16 - same pickup and drop off. Time pickup 4:29 am, $17.55. 9/10/16 - same pickup and drop off. Time pickup 4:41 am, $25.63. 7/11/16 - same pickup and drop off. Time pickup 4:42 am, $27.22. 6/8/16 - same pick up and drop off 88 Lexington Avenue. Time pickup 4:10 am, $31.13. Uber sent me a breakdown for last trip. Only thing different was the Upfront Fare Adjustment, which was now $20.90. Uber would not reimbursement me anything. So disappointed!",
1,"This past weekend I drove for Uber at 4:00 p.m., the app was doing some weird things like trying to restart and re-log. I rebooted my phone several times and I still had the same problem. Then I received a message stating that my password and debit card was invalid. So I reverified everything and even put in my debit card again. That was when the nightmare began! I received an email confirmation that the funds were transferred from my account to my bank account. Assuming it was there (bad on my part), I spent the money, only to come home and find out that Uber did not pay my bank!!! So I messaged them several times, and they have changed their story SIX different times!!! I am very fed up with Uber right now as a driver. I loved to drive, but the customer service and how they treat their drivers when there is a payment issue is unbelievable! I need to know where I can file a complaint against them about this. ",
0,It's a very simple matter. I've been using UberEATS to place orders for food. It has a program in place where if you refer someone you get 15 off. I had 3 invite codes so I placed an order for a pizza. The total came to 4.99 with my 15 off discount (which I have the receipt saved for it). Afterwards they went into my account and altered it without my knowledge and removed my promos after I placed the order and sent out a receipt for 19.99. I called them and they slightly hinted towards my account being altered by someone in email support but they didn't expand on that matter and acted as if they didn't see any of my invite codes. ,
0,"We travel quite a bit and used Uber always. It was so easy, fast pick up, clean cars, nice drivers, roomy cars, some had amenities like hard candy, and courteous drivers.  Right now three of us are crammed in a small car listening to the drivers personal conversation. We waited 10 minutes for him even though the app said three minutes away. Yesterday from the airport we were listening to the drivers music which was load and not appropriate for my son. It was loud and w asked her to shut if off but she just turned it down. Then I would crack my window and she kept shutting it. Is it NYC Uber or is it like this everywhere?  One more try maybe but then back to yellow cabs.",
1,"I ordered for an Uber pool today which is the 12/08/2016. Not only did Uber give a wrong pick up location to the driver but also charged my card twice for the correct rate and incorrect rate. After waiting 10 min in the cold for the driver, I had to direct him to the right pick up location. When he picked me up, he advised he had to first pick up to people at the Marriott which was ok with me because I had ordered for Uber pool anyway. We pick up the couple and I was dropped first. ",
0,"Driver said I cancelled. He picked me up, took me to get my son from school. His truck was nasty as hell. He was overall creepy and I will not use Uber again. He took me to get money off my card to tip him. Worthless bastard.",
0,"I was waiting in front of the pickup address on the curb, freezing. Just when the cab arrived, it suddenly left, and then a minute later I got a message saying the driver had to cancel and I should order another one. I did, two minutes after the driver canceled, which the record shows. Then I got charged five dollars for canceling! This was clearly a mistake, and I wanted to correct it. But there is NO WAY to talk to any customer support on the phone. I sent a tweet and an email, and did not get a response within 24 hours. I'm still waiting.",
1,"I worked with UberEATS for about 2 months. I accepted 100% of requests and made deliveries as quickly and efficiently as possible. One evening, there was a $20/hour promotion. It was held from 5pm to 9pm. I logged on using their app at 4:57 pm and did not log off until 9:00 pm. I looked at the app later that evening and it said I was on for only 3 hours and 21 minutes. The next day, it said 3 hours and 30 minutes. Then, when I let the help department know that this was not correct, and clearly explained why, I was told by two separate people that I was only on for 2 hours and 48 minutes. A third person said I was on for 3 hours and 47 minutes. ",
1,Without a doubt the worst experience of my life with Internet based services. Drivers in NYC either can't follow directions or have difficulty conversing in English.  I couldn't find a way to communicate my frustrations with Uber. The phone number posted goes to a fax machine or another digital line. I am a SF Bay Area resident and was shocked at my experience. Moving on to give Lyft a try.,
1,"I have been driving for Uber for 3 weeks and haven't been paid a cent! They keep telling me 'we have resolved your problem' when they bloody well have not. The keep telling me my bank info is incorrect. I have checked it 12 bloody times. It is perfect. I have sent them screenshots of my bank into and screenshots of it entered into the Uber system. 100% match. Still, the can't pay me. They tell me to go to the local Uber office, which I do. They verify that my banking info is 100% correct. So, they suggest I go to my bank. I do that. The bank verifies that the info I have given Uber is 100% correct and everyone is scratching their heads because they can't understand why Uber can't pay me the hundreds of dollars they owe me. And, all I get from Uber is copied and pasted form responses. $#*! you, Uber.",
0,"I am new to Uber. Signed up... tried to book a reservation for a ride for attending a New Year's Eve Party. Found out from a rude driver that ""that's not how Uber works."" Now tell me what good is a service like this if your can't call and make a reservation as I described? Totally useless and bound to fail in the long term... At least I hope it does...",
0,"I leased a car thru Uber leasing program in Tampa Honda. I was not given a choice of car and wound up with a 2015 Corolla with stains and burn holes on the seats. The dealership never sent a tag for the car despite me contacting them daily regarding my tag about to expire. They wouldn't issue a new temp tag, told me they mailed it out on 3 different dates and NY temporary tag expired. I couldn't drive the car illegally so it sat there for over a month until they repossessed it. I called the leasing company and was told over $1200 to redeem the car in 4 days. I called on 4th day and was told now it was over $1400 to redeem the car that day.",
1,"Really worst experience with Uber cab service. Last week I booked a ride & driver started trip without picking me. Finally after some time when I called him, he told me that he can't come & it was medical emergency.",
0,"Hi All. Just want to share my experience, I visited from pickup location to destination which was just 17 KM far but driver started the trip already that I could not check as I had full trust because it didn't happened me before. Total distance which he covered 27 KM. Friends please make sure you check pickup location correctly. I lodge case with Uber but no reply. Such cheating is going on. I could not believe it. Let me know if you know any other way to contact UBER.",
1,"After landing at Oklahoma City airport 11/28/16 for business, I requested an uber pick up to take me to my hotel. The driver was very nice and the rate was reasonable at $20.31. I then requested an uber pick to take me from the same hotel on 12/4/16 to take me to the Oklahoma City for my return flight. When I received the charge it was $40.83.",
0,"Recently, my Uber account was hacked. Suddenly I was driving all over Nigeria (I live in Minnesota). When I tried to address the hack, I discovered 1. Uber has no phone-based customer service, 2. Uber's email customer service is basically useless. 
After visiting the Uber office nearest to me, I was given a promise that the charges would be reversed and my account would be cancelled. After 3 days, the charges were reversed, but Uber refused to cancel my account. Now, more charges are being accrued and Uber customer service is again refusing to respond personally to my complaints. Guess I will be making another trip (this will be the 3rd) to the home office closest to me. 
Uber does not let you cancel your account- you must go through their customer service representatives. And when you do, they refuse to do it. I will advise every person I know to cancel their account and switch to a different ride service.",
1,"I have used Uber pretty much since it was introduced. However, now that Uber tracks your location EVEN if your phone is OFF, i'm out. I will never use Uber again until they change this policy. Deleted it from every device in my family and am passing the word to everyone who will listen to do the same.
If your a driver and want my business, switch to Lyft.
Big brother is watching and his name is Uber",
1,"Uber classified me as a low rate because of it being a four door luxury leather, fully loaded 2015 LTZ Chevrolet truck and it's white with Buckskin leather, Bose stereo system, heated air conditioned seats with Wi-Fi. And every customer that I have picked up under uberX says they did not expect this kind of ride and Uber says this truck is a low standard truck. When I email UBER over this situation they did not reply.",
0,"My wife had a foot operation and we used Uber in Miami against my wish, but the drivers had no training ie waiting for the passenger to get downstairs from their flat.
We were over charged and Uber promised but we never got the refunds.
The best option is to get a licensed cab where ever you may live, if you go to London ever, Uber cars are more expensive than black cabs in the rush hours and they don't know, even with GARMIN where they are going. PS ; Uber is valued in Billions on the stock market, because they get 15% of the cost of the ride worldwide everyday.",
1,"I have asked Uber 5 times via email for directions on creating an Uber account. It will not let us do it because it wants a mobile phone number. We are retired and have no need for a mobile phone anymore.  I need to use my house phone but it rejects it. 
How can I utilize Uber services without having to purchase a mobile phone.  It does not make any sense.   Can anyone help us?",
1,Stealing miles and therefore money from drivers. If you complain via email they use the bots to answer the dumbest questions. If you call those folks they disconnect you after waiting for 2 or 3 minutes. Virtually impossible to resolve any issues.,

0,"Was traveling home late one night, saw an extremely drunk girl on bart. She was stumbling around and said she was going to drive home. I said I would pay for her Uber to make sure she got home safely so she didn't kill anyone, then got whacked with a $150 charge. Apparently she got sick. I understand the policy, but really? So the message is, don't be a good Samaritan. Let people drive home drunk and kill themselves and others.",
0,"I order car, which was reportedly 6 minutes away, but did not arrive until 20 minutes later. I tracked the car on an app on my phone and the car was driving in circles. I texted the driver and told him I was across the street from a local college and I noticed the car do a u-turn and start heading in the right direction. If Uber doesn't have local drivers they need to say so. Why send a driver from NYC into the outer suburbs when they don't know where they are going! Also teach them to follow the directions on their GPS!",
0,"Yesterday I had a ride with Uber pool. It showed ""paying 88"" from my home to work place. But after getting down at my destination driver asked me to pay 178. This is not at all fair. The driver has cancelled other pool ride who is going to share with me and asked me to pay that amount also. Uber is not at all giving satisfaction to customers by Uber pool rides. If no one shares ride with pool, that's not my mistake. Really a worst experience.",
0,We called an Uber cab and the driver told us it would be two minutes. The driver cancelled the ride and we got charged a 5 dollar fee and we got left with no ride. Real nice scam you guys got going. Never again will I use this service.,
0,"We called an Uber to head to the San Jose airport as we often do. Our first driver showed up and asked us where we were going and we said San Jose airport. Immediately he said he is ""going to have to pass"" since he wants to get home soon. He didn't want to take us that far. I find this appalling - the airport is a 18 miles, 20 minute ride away. If he didn't want to accept passengers then why did he accept our ride? We wasted 8 minutes Waiting for him for nothing. 
We then called another Uber and she came after 5 minutes. She also asked us where we were going and when we told her the airport she said she had to pass because she didn't have proper authorization to make trips to the airport. Needless to say we were pretty pissed at this point but decided third time's a charm. 
The third driver was 5 minutes away. We called him right then and there and specifically asked him if the airport as a destination was going to be a problem. He said ""I think it's ok"". Then a couple minutes later we got a cancellation notice. That is THREE DRIVERS in a row that refused to give us a ride based on our destination. It's not like we were asking to go 100 miles away. SJC is the closest airport to the Fremont area and there was no traffic at this time of day. 
We ended up using Lyft and even with a 75% prime time charge, we knew we would get reliable service and a driver that was courteous and would take is to where we needed to go. And that is exactly what happened. Our Lyft got us there swiftly and with no issues or complaining about the destination. Uber, you have LOST this customer. I find this appalling and completely unprofessional. One cancellation I can maybe understand and brush off as a specific driver issue. 3 in a row means there is something systemic going on and that your customer service model is broken. Take care of your drivers so they take care of your customers. 
Completely unacceptable and unprofessional. Doesn't seem like there's enough reprimanding for drivers canceling on riders. Use Lyft or alternatives and stay away from Uber.",
1,I have tried to be a driver for Uber and have nothing but the run around with them. When you email them all I got was emails back from 5 to 6 different people and none of them could just answer the question I asked. They always gave me the run around. This has been going on for 2 months now. If this is how it would be if you did get to drive for them then am glad I won't be.,
1,"They do not pay enough anymore to work for. Does not even cover costs to operate and maintain a vehicle AND make a minimum wage from. Too many short rides which = NO MONEY. $2.96 each short ride. They have implemented price cuts, and they have reinforced surges (which are your only REAL hope for making enough money to pay bills) to where it is almost impossible to get a surge fare now unless you're downtown on a Saturday night, which might I add all other drivers are there, too, giving you even more competition. ",
0,"I took my first Uber in Atlanta this weekend, and I have to say I was highly impressed! The whole ride cost $19.96, we were picked up in a very clean late-model sedan, the driver was very nice. I felt very safe while he was giving us about a 15 minute ride to a suburb of Atlanta! Same ride would've probably cost nearly $50 with a cab!!! I will take Uber whenever I can!",
0,"I took an UBER from Pacific Heights to the SF airport and it cost $85.00!!!! That is outrageous! I was not told of the charge, as the driver picked me up at the airport, then stopped at my hotel to get my suitcase and then to the airport. The traffic was bad, but he should have told me it would be $85.00, that is crazy!!",
0,"My son accidently left his laptop in an Uber car. He realized that just a few minutes after the Uber car already gone. He tried to contact the driver through Uber apps, however the driver was not helpful at all. The Uber management try to help but cannot force the driver to help since the driver is an independent contractor which does not have direct responsibility to the management. Characteristic of relationship between driver and management at Uber, make passenger vulnerable. Passenger cannot ask the management to be responsible of the driver behavior.",

0,"Last night (November 18), Uber driver Dietrich in Torrance/Redondo Beach took off with my 17-year-old daughter's birthday money, gift cards, bank card, and expensive purse (~$350 total) when she briefly stepped out of the car as they stopped the ride to pick up a friend. She literally chased after the Toyota Yaris, but he wouldn't stop. She called the driver; he told her he'd come back. She waited two hours until 1 a.m. and he didn't. She contacted Uber support, who contacted the driver, who of course denies anything was in the car.",
1,"EXTREMELY disappointed with Uber. 5 days ago my account with Uber was hacked and someone in Australia (I am a US resident and have never even traveled there) charged my card upwards of $100. I had to cancel my credit card and am currently moneyless as I am away at school with no bank nearby. I have contacted Uber FIVE times and NO RESPONSE whatsoever. I cannot cancel my account as Uber does not allow customers to call a support line, forcing me to communicate via messages through my account. Ironically, none of my messages have been answered and someone is still attempting to use my account. The company does not allow you to remove credit card information from your account unless you add in another. I will never use Uber again and I recommend you do not either. If something goes wrong you will have no help whatsoever from this unprofessional company.",
0,Oct 20th ride from Milwaukee Airport to downtown which normally takes 15 minutes and did take that time again. Driver wrote down 25 minutes and charged me $61.00. It was my first and last ride with Uber. Driver lied and scammed me. You cannot get Uber by phone and neither can my credit card company. Their help does not work well and I got no answer. You can't get in touch with this bad business.,
1,"I just signed up to Uber and cannot use the app. I have downloaded it 3 times, it still does not work, so what do I do now? I want to use it in 2 days and also in London next year. The reviews I have read so far seem daunting, have I done the right thing?",
0,"For two weeks in a row while traveling for work in DFW the drivers have constantly refused to come get me because I'm outside the ""gate"". I take the bus to remote south to avoid the airport gouge price and have the city bus as a back up option. It should not matter where I am on the airport property as long as there is public access I should be able to get a ride to my destination. Especially since you have to pay money just to request a ride! I will not be using Uber again after these two horrible weeks.",

0,"When I first began operating as legal public utility transportation company serving my island community here in Hawaii, I was desperate for new business and Uber could not find an actual insured, state or county LICENSED transportation company to serve our airport. After being heavily recruited to put my BMW's in their Black-Select service at the airport with assured decent compensation, I took them up on their offer with one perspective - if they have customers that are ready NOW who will pay their fares, I would have been a fool not to be the only Uber available at a popular airport serving the wealthiest travelers in the US... & be doing it legally in the eyes of state and county governmental as an INSURED AND LICENSED PUC operator.",

1,"I have been driving for Uber for four months now. This past Halloween weekend, which is also a very busy football weekend in the area where I live and drive, I drove expecting and knowing that there would be surge pricing. We have some 1000+ college students coming into town for the FL/GA football game. I picked up three different groups of riders from the surging area (it was surging for two solid hours - that is how busy we were). When I got home after these trips I noticed that the fares were not close to what the surge pricing would make them. I immediately emailed customer service about each one of the trips, because you cannot do them but one at a time. I could not get them to understand that the surge pricing was not showing up like it showed on the map.",
0,"On Oct. 7, 2016 we needed a ride to the airport so we called Uber. We needed a XL truck. Randy came in a Lincoln Navigator. Soon as the meter started he said ""I need gas."" Now mind you the meter already started. We get to the gas station. He decides to stop the meter and cancel the trip. At $9.98, you won't get charged. He said ""But we're 1/2 a mile from our starting point."" So, he ends the trip, gives himself 5 stars. So we start over. He says he'll fix it. Instead of getting on the freeway he drives down Gratiot. I'm like ""what's wrong with the freeway."" He replied ""Uber is saying this is the way to the freeway."" Okay, traffic is light, it might cut off 5 mins. Then when we get by the freeway entrance he makes a wrong turn. I'm from Detroit and know how to get around.",

0,Repayment of money taken from my account. On the 18 of Oct. 4 withdrawals were made on my account for a service that I did not order. This was clearly a fraud committed. Uber had given me the runaround ever since. I have sent them copies of the statements to show this. They keep saying that my email address does not correspond with the account or the email address initially used. How can it? I did not order the service.,
1,"In many occasions almost daily bases Uber has underpay. Misentered time and mileage. Of course I have done my best to adjust the correct payment or close to compromising amount, but costing me spending long times to get corrections. This has become a common practice by Uber. I wonder if all drivers have such time or knowledge to claim their fair amount. Repetition of this practice is so often that I would like the authorities look into the matter to protect the drivers who don't realize or have no means.",

0,"On 22 Sept I took Uber from the Orlando Airport to Kissimmee for a cost of $90.57. On 25 Sept I took Mears Transportation on return to the airport and was charged $62.00. If Uber is supposed to be cost effective but their rate is almost $30 more than a licensed transportation company then what is the purpose of allowing them to operate in metropolitan areas? I was charged a base fare, a distance fare, time fare, 2 tolls and an airport surcharge. I checked the receipt I received from Mears to compare costs but found nothing comparable. Furthermore, I looked for ways to contact Uber but the only avenue I found was Facebook and my issue was ignored.",
0,"Asked for Uber. Was suppose to arrive in 2 minutes. Nine minutes later driver was not there.

Uber confirmed cancellation, nonetheless, charged me $5.00 for cancelling because 9 minutes had passed! WHAT A RIP OFF!! And now they are trying to introduce flying cars!! It appears ripping off ON THE GROUND is not satisfying the thievery urges of the CEO! I asked Uber for a refund. They gave me two emails they couldn't do anything because they had no history of such ride request AT ALL! MY OH MY. IF YOU HAVE NO HISTORY WHY AM I CHARGED $5.00! Nothing at Uber works correctly. Their entire system is messed up.",
0,While on a trip tried to use uber without success. There were 5 of us so we needed (according to the website XL or SUV would work) so I selected one in our area and it gave me their phone number.  I called to make sure they would be able to accomodate all of us and the driver said no so i ended up calling the local cab company.

At that point he gave us his phone no. and we told him we will call him in 4 days when we get back. ,
1,Unfair payouts to drivers. On October 23/16 I have a payout for $2.72 in South Florida. I went to Uber fare estimating feature and I enter the exact route and it estimated it for $5-6 UberX. Really? You guys are ripping me off.,
0,An Uber driver ran over my mailbox... Ok stuff happens. But then he drove away after he untangled his bumper from the wreckage! We contacted Uber because this is considered a hit and run and the driver will be arrested. No response. It's been three days and the police are baffled by Uber's customer service... Only cryptic emails. Uber should be sued for their lack of response when dangerous people drive for them and they don't react.,
1,"Doesn't matter if you agree to price surge. You are forced to agree when you have no other means of transportation and need to get home. Uber needs competition and when they get it, I will never use them again. They won't be able to surge as high then, and it won't matter if they are the cheapest. You earn my customer loyalty when you charge me fair prices even though you don't have competition. Under a mile and $28.95. ** you.",
0,I have recently been using uber in Panama central America it has turned into a nightmare experience not only with drivers but also with Uber Support personal.  one driver charged me 10 dollars for  a fare that has been costing me  only 3dollars I made a complaint and instead of supporting me they blocked me from something the driver said about me. He was not the person on the profile also and obviously just a friend of the taxi Uber Driver.  I found the app malfunctioned so many times that it caused distress to me. The drivers were so rude that they never answered calls or texts.  One taxi driver went to wrong place and did not respond to me I waited for an hour for an arrival but he never turned up.  The Uber Support personal are also rude and don't listen to your complaint properly I was actually blocked from using uber because of a driver telling lies about me.  I have never been treated so awfully by a taxi service in my entire life.,
1,"I started driving for Uber when I saw an ad on my phone claiming that I can make up to $35/hour. I drove for a total of about 30 trips. I came nowhere near making $35/hour. The fact is, after my expenses, I made as little as.15 cents per mile, equaling my guess of less than $4/hour. After around 60 days, I received a notice that I had to pay for a car inspection. This is when I decided to stop driving for Uber. So I have two complaints: The first is that Uber is falsely advertising the pay rate for their drivers. How can they keep getting away with this? Second, when I informed them that I would no longer drive for them, they blocked me as a rider. Childish and petty are the words I would use to describe Uber's business practices.",
1,"Been trying to start for weeks now. I'm trying to do this on the side. I know I'm not going to get a lot of money out of it. Their support is a joke, like somebody mentioned. I uploaded all of my paperwork. It was not going through and I had to contact them. After weeks of standard replies they finally sorted it out. Now I had to go through a background check. There is no way you can do that through your account profile. I waited on them to send me a link so I can do it. I finally did it. I received an approval and I was ready to go. I was given a $50 towards my first ride if I do it by midnight the same day. Got home ready to go only to find out my account was suspended for some reason. I go through my email to find out that they did a second background check for some reason and listed me in San Francisco even though I live and have all my paperwork from IL. ",
1,"DO NOT BUY UBER GIFT CARDS!! I purchase a $50 gift card and my account won't accept the promo code! I will push this issue because all UBER did was text me the same instructions which are on the back of my ""WORTHLESS"" gift card! Customer service is non-existent! The new gift card ""rip-off"" rollout was late September and apparently there are issues but don't expect UBER to help! My recourse? I didn't pay cash but now the ""hoop-jumping"" begins between GameStop (where I purchased the card), UBER (no one to talk to) and my credit card company!",
1,"Uber is about the worse company for customer service. You can only deal with emails back and forth until you give up. This practice should be illegal. They should be required to have an active customer service line where people can call to have their problems resolved. For one their surcharge pricing is nothing short of price gouging. My daughter has had to pay $31 for an $8 fare. Also on a different trip when my other daughter left her bag in a car, the driver never got back to us and Uber just kept emailing contact the driver. It was ridiculous.",
0,"I was waiting for a taxi at my hotel when I was approached by an Uber driver telling me he would give me a $20 cash flat rate to where I needed to go. I declined, as I had no idea who this idiot was. He then got angry with me and started yelling at me asking if I was that much of an idiot that I would spend my money on a taxi. I have never been spoken to that way by a taxi driver. Also, a registered sex offender down the street from my house, drives for Uber. You never know who you're going to get. No thank you. I'll continue to use the same taxi service that I've used for years. A child molester will not be driving my children. HELL NO!",
0,"I strongly discourage everyone from using Uber. It's only worked 1 out of the mere 3 times that I tried using it, which is plenty enough for me to steer clear for life. The other 2 occasions were a complete nightmare; the second time I tried it, I was informed that my ride would arrive to my work place in 6 minutes, but then it changed to 12 minutes then finally 32 minutes. Eventually I was waiting for an hour and a half and finally gave up. I'm sure that if I had waited longer it never would have arrived. Yet, I must mention that while watching the map on my iPhone to see when the driver was close, I specifically saw another Uber driver no more than a mile or 2 away and they just kept going. ",
0,Uber has terrible customer service. They have tried to automate their support to a point where the human component has been removed. Anyways today I have an actual issue. I took a ride that was quoted $5 and when I was charged $5 for. I received an email from Uber saying they updated the fare to $20. The explanation was the driver had a problem with the timing? It was a 4 minute ride. I can't even reach anyone at Uber and no one will get back to me. This is a terrible terrible company. Use the alternatives.,
0,"I am woman Uber driver for 1 month and half, though Uber provide both way rating and feedback from driver and rider, but Uber only listen to rider almost ignore driver's feedback. Like today, I picked up a drunk passenger, he was yelling at me when I drove in the highway due to my driver app gps use different route with his app. He was yelling at me and used very bad language on me, I don't feel safe when he is in my car. I have to stop the trip, he threatened me he will let Uber give me $0 pay for trip and he will get free ride, so now, within a few hours, I got $0 pay for that trip and my rating dropped 3 points. I email Uber about the bad experience I got no reply so far. I suspect Uber listen to the feedback from driver side. Uber only care about rider and how much money they make. They provide no protection for woman driver.",
1,"Uber charges me twice every time I request it, it charges me immediately after the end of the trip and it deducts money from my account again a few days later. I've lost so much money because of this and I'm not happy at all.",
0,I have been charged multiple times now for rides I have not taken.  And every time I try to resolve the issue I'm never able to get a hold of anybody and nobody contacts me back. It is more of a scam then a service,
0,"too many issues signing up - had to email someone twice because no clear understanding of issue.  then after I got that fixed, ran into another problem - says use the app if you have problems completing information on this web page.  had the app before but it didn't function properly.  yuck.",
1,"This is not the way to charge anything? I did not get any notifications for extra surge charges on my applications as well as I want my money back otherwise I will have to go to the consumer forum to fix this issues as you people are charging unnecessary charges to the customers without any prior information, though I have personally talk to driver and he was standing at LIG square which is only 1.5 kilometer away from pickup locations.",
0,Cincinnati Uber was horrrble. I don't ever want to Ubet in Cincinnati,
0,"Now ive got you!!!! Recently I was billed £27 for a  £14 quote and you told me I agreed to the price surge even though I was sure I didn't! Tonight I booked a cab in Manchester with a £12-14 quote and he was 8 minutes away, when he was 2 minutes away the quite suddenly became subject to a x 1.7 surge price and had I not seen it and got in the cab I would have been charged accordingly! There is NO WAY this is legal altering a quote last minute as you did last time to tell me I was wrong! I have 2 witnesses before you dare argue!! This is a con it will be posted on Facebook and I WILL be contacting trading standards! If a price surge is in effect it has to be applied at the time of booking not surreptitiously afterwards!!!!! Disgusting practice!",
0,I use UBER  frequently but this last time I was accused by a White driver that her property was stolen from her car. UBER contacted me to tell me my account had been canceled. I tried to contact UBER but they never replied back.,
1,"Former Uber partner drivers review. Worst experience driven with Uber. I never ever suggest to anybody to drive with Uber. They're more depends on Rating System. If your rating goes down, you will be fired and you will be behind the Bills. They don't care. Uber made the system in favour of the customers not the drivers who providing the safe ride in frustrating situation. Moreover Uber making the money not the drivers. If you calculate the earnings you made, you will be on minimum wage. So my advice to every newcomer: don't finance the car to join Uber. Better than do something else. Don't go to Uber. My zero star to Uber.",
1,"Uber ripped me off! Applied ""surge charge"" of 2.2x the fare but there was no prior notification of this in the app. I was not informed and did not grant permission for this. The app only showed a fare estimate of £7-9. I got home to find that a taxi journey that ALWAYS costs me around £7-9 had cost £22.50, already charged to my card and I had no means of recourse in the app. I had to go onto their website to file a ""report a serious issue with you driver"" case to get to a human and they didn't read anything of what I had written - just robotic copy and paste answers! I threatened to take it further and finally got the surge charge refunded but they said it would be a one-time gesture only, so this could happen again and I'd simply be screwed. They made out that they were doing me a massive favour and I was just lying about not being notified of the surge fare.
The next day (today), bizarrely I got an email through: ""Hi xxxx, To ensure your security, we have reset your password. To log into Uber, you will need to choose a new password.""
Then when I try to reset this I get the following: ""SOMETHING WENT WRONG. There has been an error, and we are currently looking into it.""
However others can log into their accounts using this same computer/same IP. I then checked the app and it was not accessible to me either, so they have killed my account it seems because I demanded my money back. It's fine by me because there wasn't going to be a next time anyway, but what a crooked, horrible company! Avoid!",
1,"I've only been driving with UBER for a couple of weeks in my spare time. So far my experiences with the riders has been great, but UBER now claims that my customer rating are low 4.6% and that I have only picked up 94% of the fares offered, which is NOT True. I've accepted every single fare that popped up on my phone. And you, as a driver, have no way to look at your actual customer ratings yourself. So now, it seems that I've been suspended until I pay to take a 3 hour online course!",
0,"My friends and I (4 females) were leaving Oracle Arena in Oakland California after a concert to go back to our hotel. We waited 1 hour and watched him pass us and several times before he actually stopped. We got on the freeway and rode for about 5 mins and he said we cancelled the ride. We hadn't cancelled at all. He pulled off the freeway under a dark bridge surrounded by abandoned buildings and said ""get out"" because he wasn't insured. It was about 1 AM. We begged and pleaded to take us to a place populated with lights and offered to pay cash.",
0,We caught our Uber driver stealing our phone in Las Vegas. Uber did nothing to resolve the situation. And then they sent us an email stating they investigated and the case was closed. Please take Lyft or a taxi.,
1,"After giving 1000 rides for Uber I was deactivated (fired) for low ratings (which is 4.6). I was told to take a on-line course which I had to pay for to be re-instated. Forget that. Uber thinks that all their riders are sober, sane, and kind people. Well they're NOT! I put up with so much nonsense for a $4 ride I should write a book. Uber never talks to a driver. If a driver has a problem it's ** outta luck time. Uber hides behind a computer and never communicates directly with any driver. They take whatever a riders says at face value, no questions asked. I think there should be a class action lawsuit for firing without cause. How could a company hire and fire hundreds of employees a week? Pay averages out to $12 to $15 dollars an hour. You pay gas and maintenance on your vehicle and car washes are not cheap. Riders, what do you want? Because a safe ride from point A to point B is all you're paying for.",
0,"When I arrived at Spokane, WA. I was highly recommended to utilize uber. When I scheduled my appointment via their app, the price was quoted anywhere from $11-$15. When you use their app you don't know what you are being charged until 5 mins after you leave the car when I got the shock of my life $53.46 to travel 15 mins. Way, way more than a cab. I was told I was charged $41 surcharge and that I was supposed to have been informed of this. So upset with uber, that I have vowed to never use them ever again and will tell all my friends, co-workers etc. of my upsetting experience! To add, I had to tell the driver to cut off the meter and get my own bags out of the trunk! Absolutely unacceptable!",
0,"I used Uber for the first time on Saturday morning - 24.09.16. After my friend booked me a taxi via her phone. I had never heard of the company before, as I don't use many taxis. I wasn't aware at the time of booking - payment is taken. The taxi driver asked how much I had been quoted online as I was leaving Didsbury, Manchester to Prestwich. The taxi meter was set at Â£3.75 and he stated the journey was approx 20 miles. I felt confused at the time as the driver appeared to be questioning how I was going to pay. I informed him I didn't have money and therefore he would have to stop at an atm. He took me the longest way home and I was charged nearly Â£54 for the journey!",
1,"Uber's customer accounts has been hacked and they are not reporting it to their customers. This will show up when you start getting unexpected charges on the credit card you listed on your account. You may get a receipt in your email for a trip or even Uber Eats in another state where you haven't traveled. On Uber Eats they can actually order food and have it delivered, and the total bill will be charged to your credit card. We had 2 for over $80. Since Uber has no efficient way to contact their Customer Support you may have to get creative to get their attention by sending messages through their Help system. If you are an Uber user you should consider changing your password immediately and possibly closing your account altogether. Of course you can't just do this simply and easily. Again you have to find a way to send them a message.",
1,I love Uber and it has it made it really convenient to get around.  My only issue is their receipts are like 4 pages long.  It is not necessary.  I travel for business and we need to expense these.  Can't they make them one page please!?!?!?,
0,"Today I took an UberX from where I live to the Port of Boston. After the ride back, I noticed that the ride back cost me nearly $8.00 and that I was charged $22.00 for the way in and then another $11.00 because the driver indicated we were a group of 5. I asked a revision from Uber and they just ignored my request. After another e-mail they continued ignoring my request and indicated they had solved my problem! I'm now trying Lyft. Shame on you Uber!",
0,"I left my cell phone in an Uber and I was unable to contact the driver because of it. Uber customer was terrible and kept telling to call the driver. Eventually, I changed the phone number associated with my Uber account so I could log in and call the driver but there was no phone number or option to call him... The APP told me to input the number. I explained this to customer service and they responded, ""Sorry you lost something, the best thing to do is to call your driver."" REALLY? Same answer 3 times.",
0,"We were in Florida for the past week.  We don't drink and drive so we used Uber on any evening we were going out.  Half of the drivers (men) were wonderful.  Knew their way around, friendly, awesome people.  The other half (women) didn't know where they were, didn't speak English, depended on me for directions, charged me extra because they got lost several times.  This is not a sexist comment for I am a woman!  We are not sure we will continue to use Uber.  The cost is less than a taxi but the frustration isn't worth it.  Uber needs to make sure whomever they hire actually knows the area where they are working!  Awful when you've been out having a good time, and then have to do your own work to get back to your hotel.  Stupid freaking drivers.  don't drive it you don't know where you are - common sense!",
0,"I am shaking as I write this post. I had to pull over to gather my thoughts. As I was driving west on century just outside the airport an Uber driver (black Prius, I believe-or something similar) turned right on to century directly in front of me and another car. We both slammed on our breaks and swerved to the left to avoid an accident. As he approached my right side, he rolled down his window and gave me the middle finger while yelling at the top of his lungs saying ""** YOU, go back to your country."" I'm sorry, I was born and raised in LA. I have white skin with blue eyes. My son has blonde curly hair. Do we stand out as foreigners? Even if we did, would that be a bad thing?",

I then requested another car which just drove past me. I finally had to walk to a convenience store after my phone died and call a real taxi who promptly showed up and took me home. I complained to Uber about each driver and only after 3 emails (for each driver) did my complaint actually get read. So I deleted the app and will not use these losers again. They did give me a worthless $40 credit, I mean a credit for a car service that leaves you hanging has no value. Why am I so mad? I am handicapped and walk with a cane. Should have just called a real cab to begin with.",
0,I have a free ride at Uber and wanted to avail it for the first time... The stupid driver cancelled the ride when I was already in it... It was only then when he checked my destination and began to cancel. It was irritating because I'm on a rush. The other thing is he consumed my free and charged the ride I didn't take! I saw my 200P worth of free ride was gone on my Uber account. And the Liar put a 100 consumption on the cancelled trip. He indicated I have used it! What a liar!,

0,"Really Disgusting! This is the condition of National Capital Region, the biggest frustration people facing here is conveyance and moreover traffic. Nobody is hell bothered about 9-10 hours of jobs extending to 12, 13, 14, 15 hours and so on. 
A person going to office or market thinks to book Uber/ Ola, the first question the driver asks is DROP KAHA KA HAI- i.e. Where is your drop location. Whereas, its clearly mentioned in Ubers rule book that the driver is not suppose to ask the drop location, not a big deal the rules are as fake as the company is. After waiting for 10-15 minutes, either the driver switches his mobile off, or standing at one position he will say that I am not able to track your location or even he will just sit over it and cancel the trip after 15 min with no intimation. This is not something that happens once or twice a week, this is something that happens twice/ thrice a day. Then for all the cancelled trips they will deduct 80/- (per trip), now if a person doesnt have the time to write them the incidence happened, they will not even return the money back.
Even after my last complain to uber, I attached the screenshots and sent them, these people apologized and gave me vouchers to close the matter and said that this will not happen again. But what next, everytime I should write them such detailed mail so that they pay attention to this, they dont even have a customer care. Moreover the driver has the guts to say that JAO KAR DO COMPLAIN or Okay, Jisse kehna hai kaho. Because what worst, just that they will not get the days incentives, nothing more then that. Everybody is just into money printing business, and who is the sufferer, just the common man.
Frustrated person, at last when goes to an auto wala so either he will be on strike or he asks for money as per his choice, because there are no rules. Nobody is there to check. Why is the common man working so much, just to get frustrated and depressed, for he is helpless for so many things and at last he should be happy that he has money to get admitted in a branded hospital. Anybody in India can strike for any non sense thing demanded, what should a common man do. Leave all his work and strike for the thousand things that he has to face because of wrong people into business. What is the government doing.Meru and mango are out of business because of uber and ola. If this will be the case, the day is not far off that even uber and ola will be out of business.",

1,I am a driver with Uber and my account was put on hold today 9-8-16 because they said I got a complaint on safety and a passenger said I was under the influence. First of all I rarely ever drink and I do not drink and drive and I take my job with Uber seriously. 95% of my rides on the weekend are riders who are drunk and my car can still smell like it when they get out. I let Uber know this and that I was completely offended from their accusatory email they sent me. It isn't right how Uber automatically believes the rider and they treat their drivers like crap. This is completely false and a lie and as of right now I can't drive. I have never been in an accident and I also never had an interaction with the police for being under the influence. I am so mad right now. I do not like how Uber treated me. Is there anything else I can do?,

1,"I've been a uber driver since last year, and I just had worst experience ever. They had put an hourly incentive from 8/19 Friday up to 8/21, 10:00 pm to 12:00 mn for $20 per hour, and 12:00 am to 2:00 am for $22 per hour. They had a link once you click opt in, there's nothing you need to do to have that hourly guarantee. So I tried it and made sure I covered that time now the night of the 8/20. Guess what? They didn't pay me for the difference, they only paid $52.95 which supposed to be minimum of $84, plus what I made before 10:00 pm. They keep on saying I didn't know there was an hourly guarantee which is bunch of **!!! Told them to fix and they never paid me. Watch out drivers! I didn't sleep until 2 am just to get this guarantee only finding out they won't pay me. Whoever is doing uber, quit and join Lyft hopefully is better. If we can get together and boycott uber!!!! We're working hard with our car, gas, mileage for what? For a $3.20 trip? You spend more than what you should earning.",
1,"I been driving for Uber only part time, pick up people on the way home or from work... To do this full time you have to be silly... if you calculate correctly it's not worth... I am usually lucky and transport respectful people but it still happens that crooks get in between. I had this young girl that everything matched name, destination she even confirmed she works at the place. Day later I see I made Zero $$ for that trip. Of course UBER did not inform me about any problem. Maybe hoping that I will overlook it. Turned out the girl just pretended she never took the ride... and what can you do? As other people state here, UBER will not protect you both side on as passenger or driver. Is the philosophy of the UBER CEO if someone read about him he will understand. Would be nice if the Gov would step in on corporations and monitor those better for consumer protection. Otherwise corporations will do whatever they want...",

0,"Monday evening 08-22-16; Myself, My Husband, Sister and Brother in-law contacted Uber via the mobile App. Upon doing so we were quoted a $80 ride, with possible surge increase. However the app did not in detail describe or calculate the total. So I agreed with ignorance assuming that it could not be more than a few extra bucks. Later informed by Uber that their Uber drivers were in ""High Demand"", however that isn't something I would know so I cannot say why the surge was even there? I don't travel to the city often or for that matter do so during large events. Upon traveling from N. Clark to the western suburb of Lombard, IL. Not only did our Uber driver Victor take a longer route than what we suggested, he then charged us a whopping $300.27 for the ride. That's a 3.9% increase against the normal rate. I cannot say how that is even feasible, how that is even logical or where they could calculate such an amount. ",
1,I tried to log in to Uber. I have only one email address and always use the same password for low level security websites like this. I got an error message. That was two weeks ago. I have tried to contact Uber on multiple occasions. First I had to go to google to find their phone number! Then after hours of trying to get someone on the line I finally got a human. He answered everything but my questions and after 20 minutes finally confessed he could not help me reset my password. Said I had to write an email to support@uber.com.,
1,"When I saw an ad online for the soon to be Uber delivery service, I was intrigued enough to sign up. What I did not know is it would take TWO DAYS to sign up! I started at home taking pictures of the documents they wanted and sending them. Four hours later pulling in for coffee, the first text started for me to resend the pictures. Then hours later at my volunteer job, I was doing it again. Even when I got home, this continued into the night, with emails as well. Just how many times do you need to send the requested pictures until your account goes from pending to activated? It's not that I don't have patience, it's just multiple communication can become irritating and annoying. It took THREE DAYS  (after angry communication from me to them to please STOP!) to find out it was multiple computer generated messages. Have patience if you want to try and sign up with Uber. And don't have a temper like I do!",
1,"As a driver I was assaulted by a couple guys. Uber failed to help me out as a driver. Totally took the farer's word who was extremely drunk. Kicked a dent in my car. After trying numerous times to send in pictures, Uber app kept shutting down. Also 2nd time with same results with same thing. They don't take care of their drivers.",
1,"I attempted to sign up as a driver about a month ago. The laws in my state, are such that my insurance card gets rejected. I was asked to supply additional documentation, which I did on MULTIPLE occasions. I have chatted with 4 or 5 agents, who all, supposedly, rectified the problem. Yet, after a month, I am still not approved and still have the same issue with my insurance. On the last chat, I was on hold for about 7 minutes, while the agent corrected my problem. Before he came back, I was disconnected. This company does not have the ability to serve all geographical markets. They are not equipped to deal with state-specific issues and their customer service agents, obviously, have no idea what they're doing .They have wasted too much of my time!",
1,"They don't communicate and you can't contact them.i closed my account and they did - it seems.
BUTT - they are still e-mailing me and I can't get them to stop
Think about your exit before you enter into a relationship with this company!You keep asking and I keep saying
REMOVE me from your system
NOW
